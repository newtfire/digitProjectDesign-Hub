                     <span class="person">Harriet</span> had stayed in <span class="place">Greenwich</span> over night so went in town with us. <span class="spelling" title="We">Wm</span> drove the <span class="transport">station wagon</span> with our 
                     bags. Very cleverlym selected as we had two s<span class="x" title="ii"><s>uu</s></span>t cases each and a "bottle bag and the typewriter-plus
                     a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on
                     thebbottem of a suit case for future use!
                     State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had a send of party. <span class="person">Billy</span> was hiding behind a curtain and was a HUGE
                     surprise'<span class="person">Caryl</span> had arranged it this way <span class="person">Gail's</span> mother and a friend- <span class="person">Dale</span> and <span class="person">Kissy</span> got to the <span class="place">dock</span> just after 10.30

                     and were not allowed to come on board. Too bad.
                     <span class="transport">Huge ship</span>. Like a section of the <span class="place">Waldorf- the Reacock Alley</span> plus several of the <span class="place">dining</span> rooms- afloat Streams of 
                     PEOPLE nulling about.
                     
                     We had a table in the <span class="place">dining</span> room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us
                     over and
                     next meal he wasn't there. So we <span class="spelling" title="drew">dr4ew</span> <span class="spelling" title="an">ano</span> anoother lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed
                     to-gether. 
                     Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the <span class="place">movies</span> and <span class="place">pools</span>. I won a few dollars on a pool.
                     A <span class="person">Mr and Mrs Andeson</span>, very nice friends of <span class="person">H.</span> and <span class="person">Caryls</span> asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there
                     were the parties of the Captain and the Purser Also <span class="person">Esther Boyer</span> was on board with a party of eight in cabin class, she 
                     was to steer (ab??) over <span class="place">Europe</span>. She came up and has tea with us one day.
                     The <span class="person">Captain</span> and <span class="person">Purser</span> both were on the <span class="place">Franconia</span> about years ago- as under officers- on a world cruise wer were on.
                     Both exptremely cordial. 
                     Took <span class="transport">train</span> around noon for <span class="place">Paris</span>. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.
                     <span class="place">Paris</span> and piled our belongings intoo a <span class="transport">cab</span> and landed at <span class="place">Le Br istol</span>- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble 
                     and mirrors. We had an oval white panelled round sitting room. (which we didn't need
                     and later gave up.)
                     Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the <span class="place">Crenailliere</span>(nearby) where we had a very delicious dinner.</p>

                  Dear People:
                  
                  <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-1">We are just about to take off for <span class="place">Copenhagen</span> and are sit- ting
                     around so I will try to send this second installment of our trip report. If I
                     remember correctly, the last letter came from the boat. We arrived in
                     <span class="place">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the <span class="transport">train</span> to
                     fin that it was over 90. We nearly died on the ride to <span class="place">Paris</span>. Very
                     unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we did when we arrived at
                     <span class="place">Le Bristol</span> was fall in cold tub. We went out for
                     dinner later and cele- brater with <span class="person">Charles
                              Jubilee</span>. Very tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a
                     <span class="transport">car</span> and guide and we drove all over <span class="place">Paris</span>.
                     It is so beautiful but so expensive<span class="x" title="?"><s>!</s></span>
                     <span class="fade">$</span>90 a minute to breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the
                     <span class="place">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the Left Bank, got
                     <span class="transport">train</span> tickets and that night went to the <span class="place">Casino de
                        Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I must say. We were not carried away by it
                     but did see it, so that is that.</p>
                  
                  <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-2">The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. The man and
                     his wife who ran the <span class="place">Manior Berheron</span>, where we stayed as a
                     m<span class="spelling" title="member"></span>m<span class="space" title="She left a space."></span>ber of the family were terribly nice. We
                     arravied in time for lunch and then got in a little car and went
                     through some beautiful country to see some of the chateaux. We enjoyed it
                     traemndously. You can see where the old French painters get all their inspirations.
                     Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after dinner we
                     went to a nearby chateau, Azay-le-Rideau which was illuminated. Just like fairyland.
                     They also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting
                     which told the history of the building. We will never forget it.</p>
                  
                  <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-3">Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and their little boy and and
                     ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the day before.
                     We
                     had a picnic on the way and <span class="x" title=""><s><span class="hand">tea</span></s></span> on the way home. Great
                     fun. The only thing that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all
                     about everything and told it in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter- rible row
                     with him about sports. Everyone was on my side but you couldn't get a word in edge
                     wise. Itwas rather funny to look back on but I nearly had a nervous breakdown when
                     it was going on.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-4">
                     Friday we left Tours at about eleven and got back in Paris for
                     lunch. After the lovely meal we changed out on foot to do some
                     shopping.</p>

                     <span class="place">montmartre</span> but decided to get to bed early to leave for
                     <span class="place">Brussels</span> the next day.</p>
                  
                  <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-6">We had a perfect flight from <span class="place">London</span> here. Mercedes Bucher met us
                     at the airport and we came to the hotel. the Wilsons, Mrs. BBs cousin, called and
                     came over for a drink. We then went for a delicious lunch, food is
                     marvelous here, on the <span class="place">Grand Place</span> which is fantatic. Mercedes has a
                     <span class="transport">car</span> so we spent the afternoon seeing
                     <span class="place">Brussels</span> which is very pretty. Lovely park and old buildings. Had
                     dinner in a very old place with lots of atmoshpere and good food.
                     Sunday we piled into the <span class="transport">car</span> and went to
                     <span class="place">Burges</span>, about and hour and a half away. A divine old town. We
                     took a ride in a <span class="transport">carriage</span> all over the town. Great fun. On
                     the way back we stopped for tea in the <span class="place">Osten</span> which is
                     a big seaside resort. Arrived back here at eight and ha a light supper
                     on the <span class="place">Grand Place</span> which is illuminated at night and breathtaking.
                     Yesterday we shopped most of the day and walked around seeing things. All had
                     cocktails at the <span class="place">Wilsons hotel</span> and dinner
                     later.</p>
                  
                  <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-7"> It is now Tuesday again and we leave here at 12:55 for
                     <span class="place">Copen- hagen</span> arriving there at 4:30. Have to change
                     planes in <span class="place">Amsterdam</span>. Mer- bill etc. The <span class="person">Wilsons</span> left
                     a while ago for <span class="place">Paris</span>. We will see them in <span class="place">London</span> in
                     August.</p>
                  
                  <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-8">We see by the paper that it is still unberable in <span class="place">New York</span> and
                     are pleased to be here. weather has been perfect except for the day we arrived.</p>

                     <span class="place">The Manoir de Bécheron</span> is a private home which welcomes a few paying guests. It is a rambling 15th-16th Century house 
                     situated in the peaceful valley of the<span class="place"> Indre</span> in the heart of the <span class="place">Chateaux de la Loire region</span>. The air of Old World charm
                     with modern comfort. The cuisine is French, meals are 'en famille', except for breakfast,
                     which is served in your room 
                     or if you choose, in the gardens.
                     You are one of us when we go visiting our French and American neighbors. Among them
                     are such famous artists as <span class="person">Alexander 
                              Calder</span>, <span class="person">Max Ernst</span> and <span class="person">A. Ozenfant.</span>
                     Bécheron is 25 kilometers from Tours, which can be reached by rail from <span class="place">Paris</span> in about two and half hours. Of course we
                     meet you at the station.
                     The rate in high-season <span class="date">(June 15</span>-<span class="date">August 31</span>) is $15 a day or $100 a week per person all inclusive (room, bath, 3 meals, 
                     wines, liqueurs, coffee and service). This includes the local excursions around <span class="place">Bécheron</span> such as <span class="place">Saché,</span> <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau,</span>
                     Tours, <span class="place">Langeais.</span> <span class="place">The Saché Museum </span>now houses a permanent exhibit of the sculpture of my father, <span class="person">Jo Davidson.</span> The off-season
                     rate <span class="date">(March 1</span>-<span class="date">June 14</span>; <span class="date">Sept. 1</span>-<span class="date">October 31)</span> is $10 a day or $65 a week per person. Contrary to the usual continental practice
                     there are no extra charges at Bécheron.
                     My French wife and I have two children,<span class="person"> Eva</span> age 12 and <span class="person">Laurent</span> who is 5; we can and do care for children, and you will find 
                     they are never underfoot. If you should want a place where you can safetly leave yours
                     while touring <span class="place">Europe, Bécheron</span> is 
                     the place you are looking for. Our children were born in the <span class="place">United States</span> and speak French and English as of course we do.
                     A week in <span class="place">Bécheron</span> is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the
                     illuminated chateaux;
                     they alone are worth the trip. The <span class="place">"Sleeping Beauty" castle of Usse</span>, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span>, famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but 
                     a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.
                     During one of your outings we will picnic in the <span class="place">Forêt de Loches</span> near a circular 12th Century chapel, or on the banks of the
                     Loire across from <span class="place">Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars</span>. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
                     on a picturesque medieval square.
                     We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children.
                     We'll be glad to answer any specific questions
                     you may have.
