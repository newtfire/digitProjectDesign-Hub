        <desc>Clouds form amongst darkness as words appear on the screen. Lightning strikes several
            clouds <dev>Disney Interactive Studios</dev>

            <gameTitle>Kingdom Hearts</gameTitle>
        </desc>

        <desc>The clouds part and the words rush the screen. A boy awakes, floating in a strange
            abyss, the keychain around his neck waving in the current of wind blowing upwards. Gold
            letters appear in the void</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> I've been having these weird thoughts lately... Like, is any of
            this for real or not?</sp>

        <desc>The words fade away. The boy's heart pumps as he falls deeper into the abyss, his eyes
            closed. The empty nothingness becomes water, and bubbles form in the wake of his
            descent. He reaches a barrier and his eyes blink open with a flash. He finds himself
            standing on a sandy beach on a clear sunny day. He looks around and sees another boy in
            the water. Holding his hand up to block the glare of the sun, he steps toward the boy in
            the water to get a closer look. Suddenly, the ocean waters recede. He looks up and
            gasps. The boy in the water, turns his head, the breeze billowing through his silver
            hair, as a wave forms beyond. He smirks, holding his hand out as the wave reaches its
            pinnacle behind him. The boy with brown hair runs toward the boy in the water, who isn't
            moving. Time seems to slow down as the wave crashes down on top of them. The first boy
            spins in the water, gritting his teeth. He rights himself and stares at the other boy,
            who is unfazed, saying nothing with his arm beckoning. The first boy tries to reach him,
            but is swept away with the current. He eventually surfaces, gasping for air, the water
            dripping off of him as the sun hangs low in the sky. He sees a girl on the shore waving
            to him and calling his name. He waves back and starts padding towards shore as she
            bounces happily on her feet. The girl stands with her hands behind her back as he
            arrives. He bends down slightly, catching his breath and smirks up at her. She giggles
            until something in the sky catches her attention, her face forming a serious look. He
            stands up and turns around. A meteor shower rains down from the sky, a shadowy figure
            among them. They stare in awe, and the boy realizes the figure is himself. He gasps and
            feels himself falling. He becomes the figure in the sky as he falls below the girl,
            reaching out to her. She reaches out to him until the image of her ripples in water
            reflecting the sky. The boy falls back, eyes closed, sinking deeper as bubbles trail
            him. He stirs awake and manages to right himself before settling onto a dark platform.
            He looks around and takes a step forward. There is a flash of blinding light as a large
            flock of birds rise from the platform, flying in all directions and scattering feathers
            everywhere. The boy shields his eyes as the wind whips at him. He watches them leave
            while the last feathers fall. The platform now depicts a girl taking a bite out of an
            apple. The boy turns around seeing no one, yet hearing a voice</desc>
    </cutscene>

    <cutscene type="Gameplay" cutNum="2" location="DivetotheHeart">
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> So much to do, so little time... Take your time. Don't be
            afraid. The door is still shut. Now, step forward. Can you do it?</sp>

        <desc>The boy takes a few slow steps forward. A light shines down from above as a large
            stone pedestal rises from the platform in a shower of light and magic. The boy turns
            toward it. A red shield blinks into existence, floating above it</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Power sleeps within you...</sp>
        <desc>Another pedestal rises from the platform, a blue staff floating above it. He turns
            around to face it</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> If you give it form...</sp>

        <desc>A third pedestal appears in front of the boy, who turns toward it. A metal sword
            appears in midair</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> It will give you strength.</sp>

        <desc>The boy stares ahead at all three</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Choose well.</sp>

        <desc>The boy runs over to the staff and holds it in his hands</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> The power of the mystic. Inner strength. A staff of wonder and
            ruin. Is this the power you seek?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Yes.</sp>

        <desc>Suddenly, the staff vanished from his hand</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Your path is set.</sp>

        <desc>The boy turned around to face the other two weapons</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Now, what will you give up in exchange?</sp>

        <desc>The boy approaches the sword and holds it up</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword of
            terrible destruction. You give up this power?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Yes.</sp>

        <desc>The sword disappeared</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> You've chosen the power of the mystic. You've given up the
            power of the warrior. Is this the form you choose?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Yes.</sp>

        <desc>The three stones suddenly sink into the floor, knocking the boy back onto the
            platform. The ground rumbles and he looks around. The edges of the platform crumble off
            and the platform shatters. The boy falls through darkness and lands on another platform,
            this time depicting a girl in a beautiful silver ball gown. The staff appears in his
            hand</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> You gained the power to fight.</sp>

        <desc>He slashes at the air</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> All right! You've got it. Use this power to protect yourself
            and others.</sp>

        <desc>Shadows appear</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> There will be times you have to fight. Keep your light burning
            strong.</sp>

        <desc>The boy fights off the Shadows. They fade back into the floor. One crawls around to
            his back</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Behind you!</sp>

        <desc>The boy defeats all of the Shadows. A black void appears in the center of the platform
            and he is sucked into it. He bats the darkness away and wakes up on a multicolored
            platform with three silhouettes. He sees a door near the platform edge and walks toward
            it, examining it</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> I can't open it...</sp>

        <desc>A treasure chest appears and he opens it. He turns around and a large crate and barrel
            appear. He smashes these items and opens the door. Light floods out from it and he walks
            through, squinting his eyes through the bright light. He arrives on a small island
            bridge where three kids stand quietly waiting</desc>
    </cutscene>

    <cutscene type="Gameplay" cutNum="3" location="DestinyIslands">
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Hold on. The door won't open just yet. First, tell me more
            about yourself.</sp>

        <desc>The boy walks over to a girl leaning against a rope fence</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>???????</speaker> What's most important to you?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Friendship.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>???????</speaker> Is friendship such a big deal?</sp>

        <desc>The boy talks to a boy with a large blue sport ball</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> What do you want outta life?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> To be strong.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> To be strong, huh?</sp>

        <desc>The boy walks over to a boy with a large red stick in his hand</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> What are you so afraid of?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Being indecisive.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> Being indecisive? Is that really so frightening?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> You want friendship. You want to be strong. You're afraid of
            being indecisive. Your adventure begins in the dead of night. Your road won't be easy,
            but a rising sun awaits your journey's end.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Sounds good.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> The day you will open the door is both far off and very
            near.</sp>
    </cutscene>

    <cutscene type="Gameplay" cutNum="4" location="DivetotheHeart">
        <desc>There is a flash of light and the boy finds himself on a platform of a sleeping woman
            clutching a rose. He walks across the platform and is surrounded by Shadows. He defeats
            them all and a light shines down, producing a glowing green circle, power radiating from
            it. He stands on the green circle and his cuts and bruises heal. The light splits off
            toward the edge of the platform and stairs of stained glass appear. The boy runs up the
            stairs onto another platform depicting a woman in a yellow dress and a hideous
            monster</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> The closer you get to the light, the greater your shadow
            becomes.</sp>

        <desc>The boy turns around and sees his shadow move after he does. The boy starts to back
            away as the shadow pulls itself from the ground</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> But don't be afraid. And don't forget...</sp>

        <desc>The shadow takes on the form of Darkside as the boy runs to the edge of the platform,
            nearly falling off. He turns to face Darkside as it rises to its full towering height,
            gazing at him with eerie glowing eyes. The staff appears in his hand and he stares at
            his only option. Darkside summons a ball of energy and punches the floor. The boy
            trembles as a void of darkness appears in the floor, summoning several Shadows. The boy
            swallows his fear and attacks them, while dodging larger blows from Darkside. As it
            punches the ground again, the boy seizes the opportunity and strikes at its wrist.
            Catching its attention, he jumps back and the staff vanishes from his hand. Terror fills
            his face as he is left weaponless and Darkside slams his fist into the ground, narrowly
            missing him. Sora falls in defeat and a dark void appears under him, sucking him
            in</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> ---But don't be afraid.</sp>

        <desc>The darkness engulfs his legs</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> You hold the mightiest weapon of all.</sp>

        <desc>He starts to swim away as the darkness clenches onto him. His grasping hand is lost to
            the black abyss</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> So don't forget...</sp>

        <desc>The boy lies on his back as the darkness wraps its last threads around his frightened
            eyes</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> You are the one who will open the door.</sp>
    </cutscene>

    <cutscene type="Normal" cutNum="5" location="DestinyIslands">
        <desc>On a bright sandy beach, the sun shines warmly on the same spiky-haired boy, who opens
            his sleepy eyes and sits up. He yawns, starting to lay back down again, when suddenly: a
            girl’s face</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Whoa!</sp>

        <desc>The boy jumps back up and turns around, kneeling in the sand. The girl giggles,
            hovering over him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Gimme a break, Kairi.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Sora, you lazy bum. I knew that I'd find you snoozing down
            here.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> No! This huge, black THING swallowed me up! I couldn't breathe!
            I couldn't--</sp>

        <desc>She smacks him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Ow!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Are you still dreaming?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> It wasn't a dream! Or was it? I don't know.</sp>

        <desc>He looks off toward the ocean, seeing the clouds billow in the sky</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What was that place? So bizarre...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Yeah, sure.</sp>

        <desc>She walks past him toward the water</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Say, Kairi, what was your hometown like? You know, where you
            grew up.</sp>

        <desc>Kairi stares out into the sea</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> I've told you before, I don't remember.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Nothing at all?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Nothing.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> You ever want to go back?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi (thinking)</speaker> Hmm. Well, I'm happy here.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Really...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> But you know... I wouldn't mind going to see it.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I'd like to see it too. Along with any other worlds out there. I
            wanna see 'em all!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi <desc>(facing him)</desc></speaker> So what're we waiting for?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Hey!</sp>

        <desc>They turn to see a silver-haired boy carrying a log</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Aren't you guys forgetting about me? So, I guess I'm the only
            one working on the raft.</sp>

        <desc>He tosses the log to Sora, who falls over with a yelp, and walks over to Kairi</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> And you're just as lazy as he is!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi <desc>(giggling)</desc></speaker> So you noticed. Okay, we'll finish it
            together.</sp>

        <desc>She jumps up and down as Riku sits down next to Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> I'll race you!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Huh?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> What, are you kidding?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi <desc>(giggling)</desc></speaker> Ready? Go!</sp>

        <desc>Sora and Riku glance at each other before leaping up and racing across the beach. They
            smile at each other as Kairi follows them, still giggling. Later, Sora talks to
            Kairi</desc>

    <cutscene type="Gameplay" cutNum="6" location="DestinyIslands">
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> So, can you gather the rest of the supplies? Sora, are you

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Yeah, I heard you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Okay, here's what you need to go find: Two Logs, One Cloth, One
            Rope. Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask. I'm counting on you!</sp>


        <desc>Sora runs along the beach and finds a log, along with Wakka</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Wakka</speaker> Hey, what's happening man?</sp>

        <desc>Sora defeats Wakka in a practice battle, before picking up the cloth in a small
            treehut. He sees Selphie sitting on the dock</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Tidus</speaker> Man, I’m really off today.</sp>

        <desc>Sora heads through the Seaside Shack and across the bridge to the small island, where
            he finds Riku and another log. Sora battles Riku, but loses</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Aww, man. Now the score’s 0 to 1!</sp>

        <desc>He brings back the stuff for Kairi, who's ecstatic</desc>

            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it's

        <desc>Sora rocks back and forth on the trunk of the tree</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> It's just... I've always wondered why we're here on this island.
            If there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this one? And suppose
            there are other worlds... Then ours is just a little piece of something much greater. So
            we could've just as easily ended up somewhere else, right?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora <desc>(laying down on the tree)</desc></speaker> I don't know.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Exactly. That's why we need to go out there and find out. Just
            sitting here won't change a thing. It's the same old stuff. So let's go.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> You've been thinking a lot lately, haven't you?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Thanks to you. If you hadn't come here, I probably would've
            never thought of any of this. Kairi, thanks.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> You're welcome.</sp>

        <desc>They start walking back to the dock. Kairi leads the way</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Sora.</sp>

        <desc>Sora turns around and catches a star-shaped fruit</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> You wanted one, didn't you?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> A paopu fruit...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> If two people share one, their destinies become intertwined.
            They'll remain a part of each other's lives no matter what.</sp>

        <desc>Riku walks past Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> C'mon, I know you want to try it.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What are you talking--</sp>

        <desc>Riku laughs and Sora tosses the fruit away. They all run back to the dock and head for
            home.</desc>

        <desc>Meanwhile, in another world, Donald Duck the court wizard walks proudly through the
            Colonnade of Disney Castle, passing a group of brooms carrying buckets. Donald stops in
            front of two enormous double doors. He clears his throat and knocks on three times. A
            smaller door just his size opens and he walks through</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Good morning, Your Majesty.</sp>

        <desc>He walks down the long red carpet of the Audience Chamber toward a golden

            <speaker>Donald</speaker> What!</sp>

        <desc>Pluto walks out from behind the throne, carrying an envelope in his mouth. Donald
            opens it and reads the letter. He blinks for a second, then suddenly speeds back out
            into the Colonnade. He races across the courtyard to where Goofy, Captain of the Royal
            Knights, is sleeping</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Wake up, Goofy, wake up! This is serious!!</sp>

        <desc>Goofy continues to snore and Donald’s temper gets the better of him. He points his
            finger into the air, yelling, and summons a lightning bolt, which swoops down and
            strikes Goofy in the side, jolting him awake. He sits up sleepily and looks
            around</desc>

        <desc>The next day, Sora returns to the island and visits the Cove. Riku stands there,
            waiting for him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Hey, Sora. Our raft still needs a name. Let's see... How about
            Highwind? What would you call it?</sp>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Me? Well...hm... Excalibur!</sp>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> The usual?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Let's do it!</sp>


        <desc>Kairi appears on the wooden bridge nearby</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> You guys at it again? All right, I'll be the judge. The usual
            rules apply. Take any route you want... First one to tag that tree and make it back here
            wins.</sp>

        <desc>A tree with a star-shaped crown stands on a large rock wall</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> If I win, I'm captain! And if you win...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> I get to share the paopu with Kairi.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Huh?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Deal? The winner gets to share a paopu with Kairi.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Wha... Wait a minute...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Okay! On my count:</sp>

        <desc>Riku and Sora ready to race</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Three! Two! One! Go!</sp>

        <desc>She slices through the air with her hand and both Sora and Riku race across the
            bridge. The two are neck and neck until one of the boards on the bridge collapses,
            sending Riku into the water. Sora takes this chance to run past the lookout tower and
            across the bridge. He runs up the hill towards the star tree, seeing Riku catching up to
            him, by jumping across the tops of the palm trees nearby. Sora quickly tags the tree and
            races back to the starting line. He throws a fist into the air in success</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Now the score’s 1 to 1!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Man, lighten up. It’s just a name, after all.</sp>

        <desc>Sora scowls and walks over to the makeshift raft on the other side of the Cove, where
            Kairi is standing</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi <desc>(smiling)</desc></speaker> Today we collect provisions for our
            trip! Let’s see. Sora, you’re looking for... One Seagull Egg, Three Mushrooms, Two
            Coconuts, Three Fish, and fill this up with Drinking Water. But not from the ocean!</sp>

        <desc>She hands him an empty bottle</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask.</sp>

        <desc>Sora finds a mushroom behind a rock and another amongst the bushes. He crosses a hole
            in the rocky wall, where water is trickling out and fills up the empty bottle. He
            returns to the Beach and finds Selphie on the dock again</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Selphie</speaker> Hey, Sora. Have you heard about the legendary power of the
            paopu fruit? They say if you share it with someone you really care for, it binds you
            together forever and ever through eternity! It's so romantic. I gotta try it
            sometime.</sp>

        <desc>Sora jumps into the water and catches three fish before swimming to the small island
            where Tidus is practicing</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tidus</speaker> I think you've gotten stronger, but odds are you're still no
            match for Riku. We took him on three-to-one last time, and he whipped us all. Well, I
            guess Kairi can always count on him.</sp>

        <desc>Sora walks across the bridge and climbs a tree to retrieve a seagull egg and some
            coconuts. He enters the Seaside Shack and walks down the stairs to the beach floor. He
            walks along the beach and sees Wakka</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Wakka</speaker> Me and Tidus, we are gonna do a little explorin' today. You
            know, to the secret place at the base of that tree. There's gotta be something there,
            ya?</sp>

    <cutscene type="Normal" cutNum="10" location="DestinyIslands">
        <desc>Sora enters the Secret Place and walks through an underground tunnel, with roots
            lining the walls. He reaches a room made of walled boulders with chalk drawings scrawled
            on them. The only light is from a small hole in the ceiling. Sora sees the last mushroom
            near a wooden board in the wall and plucks it from the ground. Behind the mushroom is an
            old drawing of Kairi and Sora that brings memories flooding back to him. He kneels on
            the ground, placing a hand on the drawing of Kairi with a soft smile. His mind flashes
            back to the two of them as 5 year olds when they drew each other on the walls. Sora
            sits, picking up a rock and begins carving. He stops and stares at his work. He is
            giving Kairi a paopu fruit. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him and stands up
            swiftly</desc>

        <desc>He notices a hooded figure standing in the shadows. An X is emblazoned upon its

            nothing.</sp>

        <desc>Sora looks toward the board in the wall. It resembles a door, but with no lock or
            doorknob. As Sora turns back to the figure in the shadows, it has disappeared.</desc>

            into the ears of a black-nosed chipmunk wearing an apron. Chip salutes and a second
            chipmunk, this time with a red nose, runs toward a control panel. Dale jumps up to turn
            a blue lever. Steam billows out of pipes in the ceiling as more gears spin on the walls.
            Dale leaps to the window and the two chipmunks watch a mechanical hand move across the
            room. The hand picks up Goofy, carrying him upside down with his arms outstretched.
            Donald, at his annoyance of being lifted the same way, crosses his arms and frowns. As
            the cockpit opens, Pluto runs into the room and jumps into the Gummi Ship. A light spins
            on the wall as an interstellar runway opens, lights blinking along the path. A lift
            moves the rocket ship, aiming it at the tunnel, as Daisy and Queen Minnie enter the room
            to see their departure. Donald gives Daisy a thumbs-up and a wink as the rockets engines
            start up with a shower of flames. Donald points forward to the tunnel</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Blast off!!</sp>
        <desc>In the tunnel, a large neon arrow blinks on, pointing downward. The shaft below the
            Gummi Ship opens, and the ship falls through it, Donald and Goofy screaming. The ship
            drops out of the world and the engine bursts on, sending them into space.</desc>

        <desc>Meanwhile, Sora sits alone in his bedroom in the Destiny Islands. His window is open
            slightly, the only light coming from the moon outside and his dim desk lamp. Clothes and
            books are piled on the floor as he lies on the bed, peering over at a hanging model of a
            wooden ship with a boy and a girl passenger. Sora’s thoughts drift to his earlier
            conversation with Kairi on the dock</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.</sp>

        <desc>Thunder rumbles softly outside, catching Sora’s attention and he gazes outside. In the
            darkness of the cloudy night sky, lightning flashes, striking near the small
            island</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> A storm?</sp>

        <desc>He sits up suddenly</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Oh, no, the raft!</sp>

        <desc>Later, the wind blows through his open bedroom window, shifting the curtains as a
            voice enters his room</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora’s Mom</speaker> Sora, dinner’s ready. Come on down. Sora?</sp>

        <desc>The room is empty. Sora arrives at the small island, spotting a large orb of energy
            hanging low in the sky, wind swirling in it dark depths</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What’s that?</sp>

        <desc>Sora jumps onto the dock, seeing two other boats moored there</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Riku’s boat. And Kairi’s!</sp>

        <desc>He looks around warily, seeing no one. In the dim landscape a pair of eyes emerges
            from the ground. The eyes illuminated the Shadow’s body, its antennae wriggling as it
            scans its surroundings. Another appeared and Sora gasps in fear. He takes out his wooden
            sword as one of them leaps at him, but he blocks the strike. He tries to hit them with
            the sword, but they seem unfazed by it. It feels to Sora as if it goes right through the
            creatures. Sora realizes his only option is to run and he makes his way to the wooden
            bridge, dodging strikes from the Shadows. Everywhere he runs, more appear in his wake.
            He sees Riku standing at the small island across the bridge, facing the orb in the sky.
            He appears unmoving, as if in a trance</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Where’s Kairi? I thought she was with you!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> The door has opened...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku <desc>(facing Sora)</desc></speaker> The door has opened, Sora! Now we can
            go to the outside world!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What are you talking about? We’ve gotta find Kairi!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku <desc>(abruptly)</desc></speaker> Kairi’s coming with us!</sp>

        <desc>Sora looks shocked</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Once we step through, we might not be able to come back. We may
            never see our parents again. There’s no turning back. But this may be our only chance.
            We can’t let fear stop us! I’m not afraid of the darkness!</sp>

        <desc>He holds out a hand toward Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora <desc>(uneasily)</desc></speaker> Riku...</sp>

        <desc>A pool of darkness forms at Riku’s feet, its tendrils licking at where he stands,
            wrapping around his impassive body. Sora rushes forward to save his friend, and the
            darkness grabs at him. He tries to reach toward Riku, but the weight of the darkness
            pulls him down. Riku’s face is unchanging as Sora fails to grab his hand, the darkness
            proving too much for him. He blacks out for a second before a light twinkles into
            existence. It starts out small, but soon grows into an incredible brightness. It fills
            Sora’s vision and he feels something metallic fall into his hand. He opens his eyes,
            nearly stumbling forward as the light dissipates. He stares at the large object in his
            hand. Its golden handle and silver blade shines like a sword, but the tip of the blade
            is pointed like the teeth of a key. A keychain hangs from the pommel of the weapon. A
            name whispers softly in Sora’s ear</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Keyblade... Keyblade...</sp>

        <desc>Shadows appear around him and he swung at them with the Keyblade. A Shadow, unable to
            dodge, is knocked backward in a flurry of stars. With a few more swings, the darkness of
            the Shadows is driven away by the might of the blade, and they vanish. With as many as
            he defeats, more appear and Sora races back across the bridge. He sees a strange door
            over the entrance to the Secret Place. The door opens and he runs inside to
            find...</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Kairi!</sp>

        <desc>She stands heavily in front of the door-like wall of the cave. A soft hum hangs in the
            air as she slowly turns toward him, her empty eyes weak with exhaustion</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Sora...</sp>

        <desc>Sora is startled to see her like this as she struggles to move forward to him, lifting
            a hand toward him. Suddenly, the door behind her gives way and a great wind billows
            forth. Sora stands his ground, covering his face as Kairi loses her grip, flying toward
            him. He opens his arms to catch her, but just as she reaches him, she vanishes and he
            catches nothing. Astonished by this, he loses his ground as the dark wind knocks him
            harshly out of the cave. He comes to on the beach with a grunt, the purple sky
            stretching around the island. Sora kneels in the sand looking around at the island below
            him. Large chunks of the island have broken off and risen into the sky towards the dark
            orb</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Whoa!</sp>

        <desc>The orb looms above him, lightning crackling in its dark depths as the wind swirls in
            the air with rocky and wooden debris. Sora senses a presence behind him, and stands,
            turning around to see the demon from his dreams, Darkside, gazing down at him through
            black tendrils. Sora takes out the Keyblade as Darkside kneels on the ground. Energy
            pulses in the heart-shaped hole in its torso and it releases beams that target Sora.
            Sora begins attacking its arm, while dodging the beams of energy. Darkside stands, its
            hands out of reach of Sora, and it pauses, peering at him through glowing yellow eyes.
            Sora waits, watching its every move. It leans forward clenching its hand into a fist,
            gathering strength, before slamming the fist into the ground, spewing darkness along the
            sandy floor. Shadows emerge from the dark pool. Sora races through them to the demon’s
            wrist, running along its black arm. He makes his way to Darkside’s shoulder and slams
            the blade into the creature’s face. The wind howls louder as the island creeps further
            toward the orb of energy. Sora drops to the ground as Darkside is pulled into the air.
            The wind whipping at him, he grabs a wooden board stuck in the sand and holds on for
            dear life. Every muscle in his body tenses as the wind pulls him upward. His fingers
            slowly lose their grip and he is sucked into the orb, screaming.</desc>

        <desc>Meanwhile in a quiet village, Goofy, Donald, and Pluto walk through town. Something in
            the sky catches Goofy’s attention and he stops, gazing upward. Donald turns around as
            Goofy points upward. Donald follows his gaze and gasps</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Look, a star’s goin’ out!</sp>

        <desc>A bright star in the night sky twinkles and blinks out of existence. Donald’s face
            turns serious</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Come on. Let’s hurry.</sp>

        <desc>Goofy nods and they walk through the center of the main district toward a flight of
            steps. The neon letters of the various shops blink in the night air while a few
            townsfolk inhabit the picturesque town square. Pluto runs ahead of the two</desc>

        <desc>They reach the top of the steps in front of an accessory shop. Pluto sniffs around a
            dark alleyway, while Donald walks off to the right on his own course. Goofy notices
            Pluto and stops</desc>
        <sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy <desc>(calling)</desc></speaker> Come on, Pluto.</sp>

        <desc>Pluto continues his search down the alley, turning a corner at a pile of wooden
            crates. He comes across a sleeping Sora and licks his face. Sora’s eyes blink open
            slowly and he peers around sleepily, seeing the dog, who happily wags his tail at the
            sight of him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What a dream...</sp>

        <desc>He starts nodding off again and Pluto pounces on him. He gives off a startled
            yell</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> This isn’t a dream!</sp>

        <desc>He squints at the dog, his eyes focusing for a moment, before standing up. He searches
            his surroundings. Several notices are pinned up on a wall nearby, but even in the
            dimness of the alleyway, what he sees is not familiar</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Where am I?</sp>

        <desc>He turns toward the brighter end of the alley</desc>

        <desc>He bends down to address Pluto</desc>

        <desc>Sora leaves the shop and finds the entrance to the Second District. As he enters, a
            man stumbles out in front of him. A glowing heart bursts from his chest and floats over
            to an orb of darkness. They merge and form a creature similar to a Soldier, with a
            strange emblem on its chest. It moves awkwardly, doing a somersault in the air before
            disappearing. Sora rushes over to where the man’s body once lay and a group of Shadows
            surrounds him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> It’s those creatures from the island!</sp>

        <desc>The man takes out a Gunblade, slinging it over his shoulder before holding it firmly
            in his strong hands. He summons a Fire spell and shoots it at Sora, who dodges and runs
            toward the man. He gets in a few hits with the Keyblade before taking a large hit from
            the Gunblade, knocking him backward. He runs further away, but the man leaps over and
            corners him. He leaps over the wall to the main square and the man shoots another Fire
            spell at him, which Sora blocks and sends flying back at the man. Sora stops for a
            second, hearing nothing and runs back over the wall to find the man stunned. As he gets
            closer, the man snaps back and strikes him hard in the chest. Sora stands for a second,
            wobbling on his feet, before falling over backward onto the cobblestone ground.The man

            <speaker>??????</speaker> Excuse me. Did the king send you?</sp>

        <desc>At the mention of the King, Donald stops shaking and the two of them turn to see a
            young woman with flowing brown hair tied in a bow. She wears a long pink dress and brown
            boots. She smiles at the two of them. Soon after, Sora is starting to wake up</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Come on, lazy bum. Wake up.</sp>

        <desc>Sora shakes his head and opens his eyes. He looks up to see Kairi peering down at him
            on the bed</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> You okay?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I guess...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Those creatures that attacked you are after the Keyblade. But
            it’s your heart they really want, because you wield the Keyblade.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I’m so glad that you’re okay, Kairi.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Kairi? Who are you talking about?</sp>

        <desc>Kairi’s voice changes</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>??????</speaker> I’m the great ninja Yuffie.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Huh?</sp>

        <desc>Sora’s world flashes and the dark-haired girl from earlier appears in Kairi’s place,
            bending over him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> I think you might’ve overdone it, Squall.</sp>

        <desc>The tall man from before walks into the green room</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> That’s Leon.</sp>

        <desc>Sora sees the Keyblade leaning against the wall</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> The Keyblade...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Yeah, we had to get it away from you to shake off those
            creatures. It turns out that’s how they were tracking you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon <desc>(crossing his arms)</desc></speaker> It was the only way to conceal
            your heart from them. But it won’t work for long.</sp>

        <desc>Sora sits on the bed, staring down at the floor</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Still hard to believe that you of all people are the chosen
            one.</sp>

        <desc>Leon picks up the Keyblade and swings it in the air. It flashes out of his hand and
            back into Sora’s. Leon walks over to him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Well, I suppose beggars can’t be choosers.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Why don’t you start making sense! What’s going on here?</sp>

        <desc>At this point in time, Aerith has led Donald and Goofy to the adjacent red room</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Okay, you know there are many other worlds out there besides
            your castle and this town, right?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Yeah.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> But they’re supposed to be a secret.</sp>

        <desc>He covers his mouth</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> They’ve been secret because they’ve never been connected.
            Until now.</sp>

        <desc>Her thoughts drift to nearly a decade earlier</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> When the Heartless came, everything changed.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> The Heartless?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> The ones who attacked you, you remember?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Those without hearts.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> The darkness in people’s hearts—that’s what attracts
            them.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> And there is darkness within every heart.</sp>

        <desc>Yuffie looks toward Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Hey, have you heard of someone named Ansem?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Ansem?</sp>

        <desc>He places a hand to his chin</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> He was studying the Heartless. He recorded all of his findings
            in a very detailed report.</sp>

        <desc>Donald crosses his arms and taps his foot on the wood floor</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Gawrsh, uh, can we see it?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith (shaking her head)</speaker> It’s pages are scattered everywhere.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Scattered?</sp>

        <desc>Donald stops tapping</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> To many worlds.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Oh, then maybe the king went to find ‘em.</sp>

        <desc>He slams a fist down into his hand and Donald nods</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Yes, those were my thoughts exactly.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> We’ve gotta find him quick!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Wait!</sp>

        <desc>He looks over, and pulls the screen down towards him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> First, we need that <q>key</q>!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> That’s right. The Keyblade.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> So...this is the key?</sp>

        <desc>Sora holds up the Keyblade</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie <desc>(nodding)</desc></speaker> Exactly!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.</sp>

        <desc>He walks over to the door</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> That’s why they’ll keep coming after you no matter what.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Well, I didn’t ask for this.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> The Keyblade chooses its master. And it chose you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> So tough luck.</sp>

        <desc>He leans against the door</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> How did all this happen? I remember being in my room...</sp>

        <desc>He gasps sharply, standing up and looking to them frantically</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Wait a minute! What happened to my home? My island? Riku!
            Kairi!</sp>
        <sp>

        <desc>Sora looks down sadly. Yuffie tries to change the subject</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Hey, cheer up! I’ve heard that the Keyblade can open all sorts

        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Sooner or later, the Heartless will find you. You’d best prepare

        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Yuffie, let’s go join Aerith. She should be there now with the
            other visitors.</sp>

        <desc>Yuffie points to the other end of the room</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Leon!</sp>

        <desc>A Soldier Heartless appears, clattering awkwardly. Leon runs forward</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Yuffie, go!</sp>

        <desc>Yuffie runs into the Red Room, squashing Donald behind it with a squawk. Aerith’s face
            turns serious</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Yuffie?</sp>

        <desc>She runs after Yuffie as Leon takes out his Gunblade</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Sora, let’s go!</sp>

        <desc>Leon slams the Heartless through the window of the room and it flies over the balcony
            and down to the Alleyway below. Leon runs after it, Sora following. The Red Room door
            closes and Goofy stares at Donald flattened against the wall. Down in the Alleyway, more
            Heartless have appeared around them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Don’t bother with the small fry. Find the leader! Let’s go!</sp>

        <desc>Leon runs down the Alley toward the door to the main district. Sora fights Heartless
            as he makes his way to the Third District. Sora runs down the stairs into the square as
            Goofy watches from a high balcony.</desc>

        <desc>Goofy turns around as Heartless appear around him and Donald. He takes out his
            shield</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Gawrsh, are these the Heartless guys?</sp>

        <desc>Donald swings his wand in front of him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Let’s go get ‘em, Goofy!</sp>

        <desc>With a loud crash, the two of them are blasted off the balcony. Sora turns, hearing
            the commotion, and tries to run as Donald and Goofy fall on top of him. Stars appear
            around their heads before they see the Keyblade</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald &amp; Goofy</speaker> The key!</sp>

        <desc>They smile as Sora winces. The District starts to rumble and they look around, still
            in a pile on the ground. Large blocks appear from the ground and cover the exits.
            Heartless surround them as they stand up, ready to fight. After defeating the horde of
            Soldiers, they hear a clattering sound from above. Sora looks up to see huge pieces of
            armor falling from the sky. They hit the ground and bounce into the air, spinning
            wildly. The arms of the Guard Armor form around the torso, which is emblazoned with a
            red and black symbol. Once the legs attach, the Heartless lands on the ground loudly. It
            stands there for a moment before the helmet slams down onto the torso with a bright
            flash. It spins its head and arms before walking toward the trio. Sora attacks its arms,
            but it hardly recoils in its pursuit of him. Donald and Goofy do their best to strike
            the tough armor. It begins spinning its arms wildly around its body. Donald is caught in
            the twister and is knocked out. Sora strikes at one of the arms and the Guard Armor
            stomps the ground in anger. It jumps into the air and its pieces clatter to the ground
            heavily. Sora strikes an arm off while Goofy heals Donald and they tag-team against its
            thunderous legs. With the appendages destroyed, the torso is left defenseless and it
            falls to the ground. Sora, Donald, and Goofy approach and it begins spinning out of
            control, knocking the three of them back. Once they find their footing again, Sora gives
            the armor a final strike and it starts to explode from the inside, shaking the area
            around it. Its head wobbles and falls to the ground with a mighty ring. A large glowing
            heart floats out of its torso into the air and the Guard Armor disappears.</desc>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What’s wrong?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> They’re quite upset, these Dalmatians. They’ve lost their

            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Sora, would you look for the puppies?</sp>

            they reach the bottom, Sora and Donald land softly on their feet, while Goofy falls over
            with a big thump. They hear the quick pattering of feet as a white rabbit in a waistcoat

            smaller door underneath. They enter the Bizarre Room and see the White Rabbit scurrying
            across the tiled floor, several sizes smaller than before. The ticking sounds of a
            multitude of clocks lining the walls fills their ears as they watch the rabbit run
            through a small wooden door with a large doorknob on the edge of the room. Sora walks

        <desc>Sora turns and sees a table and chair form out of the floor. Two bottles appear on the
            table. The trio drink from the blue bottle and shrink down to the size of the door.
            Heartless appear and they defeat them, but by that time, the doorknob has gone back to
            sleep and the door will not open. They find another entrance to the Queen’s

            again, this time on top of the huge stone stove. Near the two burners, they find a
            Stench. They return to the Lotus Forest and travel further in, finding a large boulder
            and several Dalmatian puppies. They climb the boulder and reach a lily pad, where they
            discover an Antenna. As they travel along lily pads, they see a hole in a high corner of
            the woods. They make their way over and enter. They fall into the Bizarre Room, on top
            of a faucet sticking out of the wall. Jumping to a nearby wooden ledge, they find some
            Claw Marks. After saving this evidence, the Cheshire Cat appears on the faucet, still

        <desc>The podiums and hedges disappear and a large crank tower rises from the floor. The Ten

        <desc>Sora runs up to the Queen of Hearts, who tries to fight back with magic from her fan.
            Sora dodges this and knocks her over, exposing her heart- patterned bloomers. At this

            legs</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Have you seen Alice?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> Alice, no. Shadows, yes!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Where did they go?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> This way? That way? Does it matter? Left, right, up,
            down! All mixed up thanks to the shadows! Step deeper into the forest to the deserted
            garden. You might find shadows in the upside-down room!</sp>

        <desc>The cat vanishes and Heartless appear again. Once they dispel the horde of creatures,
            they find a thirsty flower</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Flower</speaker> Give me a potion and I’ll make you bigger.</sp>

        <desc>Sora obliged and grew until he could almost touch the treetops. He knocks the boulder
            into the pond and more lily pads rise out of it. He finds a large nut at the top of a
            tree and uses his Keyblade to knock it down. He eats it and returns to Donald and
            Goofy’s size. They travel to the back of the wood and find another entrance to the
            Bizarre Room. This time, they find themselves standing on the side of the room. More
            Heartless appear and in the shuffle, Sora knocks a teddy bear off a shelf and it falls
            horizontally onto the armchairs below. Sora lights one of the lamps in the room, which
            reveals a painting on the floor of a beach in both night and day. They enter the
            painting and return to the Lotus Forest. At the furthest part of the forest, they enter
            the Tea Party Garden, seeing a long table with several chairs. Teapots and dinnerware
            line the table as lanterns hang overhead. A painting of the Mad Hatter and the March
            Hare is hung at the edge of the table. The expressions on their faces is one of sadness.
            A sign is posted next to them reading <q>A very merry unbirthday. Sit down to get your
                present.</q> They sit at various chairs and the Hatter &amp; Hare’s painted
            expressions change to ones of joy and happiness. The enter the door in the house nearby
            and find themselves standing on the ceiling of the Bizarre Room. The Cheshire Cat sits
            waiting for them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> They’re hiding somewhere. And the momeraths outgrabe.
            Want to find the shadows? Try turning on the light.</sp>

        <desc>The cat vanishes and Sora jumps onto one of the lamps and lights it. The cat reappears
            on the other lamp</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> It’s too dim. Make it brighter.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What next?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> One more lamp that you need to light.</sp>

        <desc>The cat disappears and Sora lights the other lamp, summoning the cat once more</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> All the lights are on. You’ll see the shadows soon.
            They’ll arise in this room, but somewhere else. The shadows might go after that
            doorknob, too.</sp>

        <desc>The cat leaves and they make their way back to the Queen’s Castle to enter the correct
            way into the Bizarre Room. Upon entering the room, they spot the Cheshire Cat on the
            table</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> You’ll have a better view from higher up.</sp>

        <desc>Sora, Donald, and Goofy climb the table and the cat stands up</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> The shadows should be here soon.</sp>

        <desc>He taps his toes daintily on the table</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cheshire Cat</speaker> Are you prepared for the worst? If not, too bad!</sp>

        <desc>He points upward and the enormous Trickmaster Heartless appears. It lands on the floor
            with its accordion-like hands and jumps over the table, landing on its large pointed
            boots. It stands up to its full height, towering over the table, unraveling both of its
            long arms. It stares down at them with its five stacked heads. It folds its arms
            together and pulls out two giant matches, twirling them in the air. Sora gets a running
            start, leaping off the table and striking at the Trickmaster’s faces as it raises its
            matches high in the air. It slams them down onto the chair, sending it flattened into
            the floor. Sora jumps up, using the length of his Keyblade to deal blows to the
            Trickmaster. He knocks it out for a second, and it falls to its knees, though not for
            long. It starts to sing to itself and swings wildly, hitting Donald, who shrieks. It
            continues twirling the matches, walking over to the stove. It bends over the stove and
            lights them, sending fireballs at the three of them. Goofy blocks them with his shield
            and Sora sends a Blizzard spell, effectively putting the fire out. After several more
            hits, the Trickmaster lowers its arms and falls to the ground. It attempts to stand, but
            crashes to the ground, its arms laying at its side. A large heart floats of its torso
            and it disappears.</desc>

        <desc>It yawns widely and they see a Keyhole inside its mouth. A light shines around Sora’s
            Keyblade and it reacts with a will of its own, pointing at the Keyhole and releasing a

            They enter the Coliseum Gates, where two giant golden statues of gladiators clashing
            swords stand around the entrance. They walk across the grounds and enter the Coliseum.
            Walking into the dim lobby, the cracks in the stone visible underfoot, a satyr is
            putting up a sign on the wall near an entrance. A <q>closed</q> sign is tied in the dark
            doorway and a large pedestal is placed against a wall near a lit torch. Sora walks up to

        <desc>Sora starts to run back into the Coliseum</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> Kid, you’re not entering the arena, are ya? This ain’t
            just some match. This is for real!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I’m not afraid. You can decide if I’m hero material or not.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> Careful, kid!</sp>

        <desc>Sora and company reenters the Coliseum arena, where Hercules has Cloud slung over his
            shoulder, Cerberus’s giant jaws bearing down on him, inches away. The beast’s ears perk
            up, hearing their entrance and they turn around, allowing Hercules to run Cloud to the
            Lobby, past Phil</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> Kid, I got two words of advice for you: Attack!</sp>

        <desc>Cerberus roars and stomps around the arena, sending large fireballs at Sora, Donald,
            and Goofy. Sora manages to stay out of the beast’s path, Donald sending Thunder spells
            at its three heads. One of the fireballs heads Sora’s way, and he deflects it with his
            Keyblade, hitting the center head square in the eyes. The beast stops, roaring, and
            attempts to bite him as he attacks. Backing up, Cerberus rears up on its hind legs, and
            drops to the ground, sending a shockwave to the trio. Sora heals with a Potion as the
            beast’s mouth foams with dark energy. It moves forward sending dark matter spewing out
            of its mouth and into the ground. Sora rolls to dodge as the energy pools and shoots up
            from under him. Goofy, finding a way on top of the beast, sends his shield flying at the
            multiple heads. Sora moves in as it tries to bite at Goofy and knocks out the beast,
            which falls to the ground loudly.</desc>

            <speaker>Cloud</speaker> I’m looking for someone. Hades promised to help. I tried to

        <desc>He stands up and looks to the sky</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cloud</speaker> I fell into darkness, and I couldn’t find the light.</sp>

        <desc>Out of the rafters a claw appears. Sora looks up in time to see a leopard pouncing in
            his direction. Sora leaps up and blocks with his Keyblade. He jumps back as the leopard
            lands on the wooden floor and knocks Sora away. The leopard roars and tries to claw at
            him, but he slides away and strikes with his Keyblade, sending it flying across the
            room. After a tough struggle, it lies on the floor, tricking Sora into coming closer.
            Suddenly, it leaps up and roars as someone enters through a hole in the ceiling. He
            spins around the rafters and leaps to the floor. As the leopard pounces at Sora, the man
            blocks its bite with a spear. The leopard struggles wildly, its jaws clamped around the
            spear. The man knocks it back, glaring at it, and it snarls before leaping out a window,
            sending shards of glass flying everywhere. The wild man puts away his spear and
            addresses Sora. He has long brown dreadlocks and wears a loincloth over his toned body.

            <speaker>Clayton</speaker> Young man, we’ve been in this jungle for some time now. But
            we have yet to encounter these friends of yours. I’d wager they’re with the gorillas.
            But Tarzan refuses to take us to them.</sp>

            <speaker>Jane</speaker> Really, Mr. Clayton. Tarzan wouldn’t hide—</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Clayton</speaker> Then take us there! Take us to the gorillas.</sp>

        <desc>He smiles and they leave the tent. Sabor attacks, but is sent scurrying back into the

            climbable ivy and take it into a higher area of the trees. Tarzan finds Kerchak and Kala
            among the trees, numerous vines hanging around them. Kerchak looks sternly at Sora,

        <desc>He hears a rustling from the jungle and stops before the pipe reaches his mouth. He

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Heartless!</sp>

        <desc>They notice Sora and attack the group as the gorilla hides. They defeat the Heartless

        <desc>They exit the tent and hear a gunshot from the direction of the Bamboo Thicket. They
            run into the thicket and find Clayton’s pipe on the mound in the center. A shadow leaps
            over them and Sabor lands, roaring at them, teeth bared. It claws the air towards Sora,
            but Donald sends a Fire spell at it. Sora strikes it with the Keyblade and it jumps into
            the tall stalks of bamboo. They wait for it to emerge, Tarzan listening keenly. It leaps
            out and Tarzan assaults it with his spear, spinning it wildly. Goofy tackles it with his
            shield and it tries to bite him. They continue attacking it until it slows down, its
            vision going blurry. Sabor looks up to the sun, falling unconscious, and collapses to
            the ground, losing a fang in the process.</desc>

        <desc>They run to the cliff area, where the gorillas have been rounded up by Clayton and the
            Heartless. Clayton loads and cocks his rifle, aiming it at Kala. Kerchak roars as
            Heartless pounce in his direction. Clayton puts his finger on the trigger as Sora runs
            in</desc>

        <desc>Clayton gives out a yell and the fight begins. Donald, Goofy, and Tarzan go after the
            Heartless, while Sora takes on Clayton. The hunter fights back, aiming his rifle at them
            before the cliff behind them explodes. Tarzan rushes forward, but is knocked back by an
            invisible creature. It calls out and Clayton mounts it, reloading his rifle and aiming
            it at them again. Sora attacks the creature, causing it to shed its invisibility. The
            great green chameleon stares at them through wild spinning eyes. It sends out beams of
            energy before jumping up to a high ledge, and Donald calls down a Thunder spell, while
            Tarzan climbs the vines along the wall towards it. He stabs it with his spear and it
            reels backward, knocking Clayton from its back</desc>

            <speaker>Clayton</speaker> Lazy beast!</sp>

        <desc>The Stealth Sneak Heartless fell to the ground as Clayton picks himself up. He aims at
            Sora, but is tackled by Goofy’s shield. Sora strikes the Heartless with a flurry of
            attacks while Donald casts magic spells. Tarzan faces Clayton and forces him towards the
            waterfall. He clutches his chest and aims his rifle at them, his eyes staring daggers.
            The Heartless rises up behind him slowly, sparks crackling around it, cause Clayton to
            turn around. It begins to fall on him and he screams. A glowing heart bursts from its
            chest and floats into the air as Clayton and the Heartless disappear. Kala and the other
            gorillas gather nearby as Kerchak walks up to Sora. He grabs him by the collar of his
            jacket and tosses him into the air. Sora lands with a thud on the top of the cliff.
            Donald and Goofy follow suit while Tarzan climbs to meet them. They look down towards
            the gorillas, who leave. Tarzan crawls over to the lake, where the waterfall

            they scatter around the cavern, revealing a Keyhole. Sora aims his Keyblade and seals
            the Keyhole. It glows with a bright light and a locking sound before a green gummi block

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hey, Leon. This gummi block’s different from the others. Do you

        <desc>Leon has no answer</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Ask Cid. He should know.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Wait, Sora. Take this with you.</sp>

        <desc>He gives him a stone</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> This stone holds some mysterious power. I’ve been carrying it
            for luck. I want you to hold onto it.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> How do you use it?</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> You’re kiddin’ me! You’re flyin’ a gummi ship and you don’t know
            nothin’ about navigation gummis? Bunch of pinheads. Interspace ain’t no playground.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> There’s a lot we don’t know. So what! We have to use the gummi
            ship to go to other worlds. We don’t have a choice.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Whoa, easy.</sp>

        <desc>He scratches his head</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> I didn’t know. No hard feelings, all right? Well, I guess I could

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Thanks.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Basically, with navigation gummis, you can go to new places. You
            want one on your ship, right?</sp>

        <desc>They nod</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> I’ll install it for you. But I got this thing I gotta go deliver
            first.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What do you need to deliver?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Just this book. It’s real old. When the guy brought it in, it was
            practically falling apart. Too beat up to restore it to the way it was. But overall, I
            did a decent job puttin’ it back together. Anyway, you mind deliverin’ it for me? It’s
            the old house past the Third District. Look for a big fire sign.</sp>

        <desc>He hands Sora the old book before a loud bell rings</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Wh-What was that?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Hmm? The bell at the gizmo shop is ringing. Go check it out if
            you want, but deliver that book for me first. When you’re done, stop by the house in the
            Third District. I’ll be there.</sp>

        <desc>They leave the shop and enter the Third District, finding the fire sign at the end of
            an alley. Sora hits it with a Fire spell and the door unlocks. They enter a large cavern
            where a mystical house sits on a central island. Several stepping stones line the path
            in the water. Sora jumps on them and they begin to move rhythmically. Timing themselves,
            they traverse the stones and reach the house. The house looks beaten and worn down
            despite its festive purple hue. The front entrance way is covered in wooden boards and
            cloth. They find a broken hole in the side of the brick wall with a green curtain draped
            over it, and use it to get into the house. They enter an empty space with a raised
            platform in the center.</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>??????</speaker> Oh, my. No. My name is Merlin. As you can see, I am a
            sorcerer. I spend much of my time traveling. It’s good to be home. Your king has
            requested my help.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> King Mickey?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Yes, indeed. Donald, Goofy. And who might you be, young
            man?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I’m Sora.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Ah. So, you have found the key.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> What did the king ask you to do?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Just a moment...</sp>

        <desc>He walks up to the stairs and sets down his carpet bag before reaching the center of
            the raised platform. He lifts his wand high in the air</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Presto!</sp>

        <desc>Dust flies around the carpet bag as it opens and out pops teapots, tables, drawers,
            and chairs, small at first, but quickly growing larger. The wacky wizard dances around
            while waving his wand, directing the items from the bag to their respective places in
            the house. Soon after, the room is entirely furnished, complete with bed, desk, and
            multiple piles of books</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> There, now. Ahem.</sp>

        <desc>He turns to face Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Your king asked me to train you in the art of magic. We can
            start anytime you like. Let me know when you’re ready to begin the training. Oh, and one
            more thing.</sp>

        <desc>He turns to the entrance where a small model of a royal carriage is placed on the
            floor next to the telescope in the open window. Magic sparkles in the air coalesce at
            the carriage’s place and form an elderly woman in blue robes with a pink bow around her
            neck. She wears her hood over her white hair and holds up a long magic wand. She smiles
            at them sweetly</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> Hello. I’m the Fairy Godmother. Your king asked me to help,
            too. I will assist throughout your journey.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> I do not know how much I can be of help, but do stop by
            anytime.</sp>

        <desc>Sora hands him the book</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Oh, that book... So, Cid asked you to bring this. Thank you.
            You wish to know what kind of book it is? I don’t even know, myself. In fact, it’s not
            mine. Somehow it found its way into my bag one day. It was such a curious book, I asked
            Cid to repair it for me. Well, I guess I’ll put it here somewhere, for now. This book
            holds a great secret. The missing pages will unlock it.</sp>

        <desc>He points to a small bedside table</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> I’ll leave the book over there. Do look at it whenever you
            like. My best regards to Cid for repairing it for me. Oh, and about that stone of
            yours... You should ask the Fairy Godmother about that.</sp>

        <desc>They speak to the Fairy Godmother and show her Leon’s stone</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Do you know what this is?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Fairy Godmother</speaker> Oh, the poor thing! He has turned into a summon
            gem.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> A summon gem?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Fairy Godmother</speaker> This little creature lived in a world that was
            consumed by darkness. When a world vanishes, so do its inhabitants. But this one has
            such a strong heart, he became a gem instead of vanishing with his world.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Can he regain himself?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Fairy Godmother</speaker> Yes, but only his spirit. Now, watch!</sp>

        <desc>She waves her wand</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Fairy Godmother</speaker> Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!</sp>

        <desc>Sora is granted the power to summon Simba</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Fairy Godmother</speaker> Whenever you call, he will help you. If you find any
            more of these, bring them to me. Don’t worry, when their worlds are restored they will
            return there. Sora, please help save them.</sp>

            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Well, we all lived here in the Hundred Acre Wood. And we’d take
            walks together, or play Pooh sticks... And every day, I’d eat some honey. Just one small

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Okay, so you’re coming with us, right? We’ve got this awesome
            rocket. Wait ‘til you see it!</sp>

            <speaker>Donald <desc>(rudely)</desc></speaker> No, he can’t come!</sp>

        <desc>They walk up the stairs to the Small House, seeing the lights on in the window and

            <speaker>Cid</speaker> A witch, man, she’s a witch!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> She’s the reason this town is full of Heartless. Don’t take her
            lightly.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> She’s been using the Heartless for years.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> We lost our world, thanks to her.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> One day, a swarm of Heartless took over our world!</sp>

            <speaker>Leon</speaker> That was nine years ago.</sp>

            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Our ruler was a wise man named Ansem. He dedicated his life to

        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> His report should tell us how to get rid of the Heartless.</sp>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Where’s this report?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> We don’t know. It got scattered when our world was

            trying to find your dear friend, he quite simply replaced you with some new companions.

        <desc>In the Small House, they carry on their conversation</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> So, you delivered that book? That navigation gummi’s installed
            and ready to go. You find another one, you bring it to me. I threw in a warp gummi for
            the heck of it. Now you can jump to worlds you’ve been to before. Well, better get back
            to my real job. What’s my real job? You’ll see. See me at the First District.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> I’ve been thinking about the bell in the Second District.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> That one that rang a bit ago?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> The one above the gizmo shop. There’s a legend about it, you
            know.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> But it’s all boarded up. Nobody can get in there.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Heck, go check it out. Ring it three times to see if anything
            happens.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They leave and enter the Second District, battling Heartless on their way to the roof
            of the Gizmo Shop. They take down the wooden boards of the bell tower and Sora rings the
            bell</desc>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The mural in the fountain in the square below changes and the empty fountain fills
            with flames. Sora rings it again and the mural changes once more, the fire dissipating
            and the lights above the fountain blink on. When the bell tolls the third time, the
            lights shut off and water spurts out of the fountain, the mural changing finally to
            butterflies surrounding a flower, which then reveals a large Keyhole. They jump down to
            the square and approach the fountain when the Guard Armor drops from the sky. Sora
            begins attacking the torso of the Heartless while Donald and Goofy go after its legs. It
            spins its arms wildly and with a few more hits, it crashes to the ground, motionless.
            The trio pauses, watching as the armor twitches. It reforms its body and falls forward,
            its arms digging into the ground. Its torso and legs flip over, and the toes of its
            hammer- like feet curve inwards, forming hands. Its helmet opens and its yellow eyes
            stare blankly at them. It lunges forward and meets the blade in Sora’s hands. The
            Opposite Armor continues to tackle them, floating in midair. The Heartless soon splits
            itself in half, the helmet and arms going after Sora, and the feet and torso find their
            targets in Donald and Goofy. Donald summons a Thunder spell, sending bolts of
            electricity into the armor. The helmet swirls around between the arms, almost taunting
            them, before its body reforms. It moves to tackle them again, but mid-tackle, Sora
            strikes, knocking its parts everywhere. Nearly defenseless, they destroy its appendages,
            leaving just the torso and helmet. It turns its torso sideways, staring at them with its
            glowing eyes. A ball of energy shoots out from inside it, and it targets Sora, who
            dodges away. Another ball of energy shoots out, and this time Sora is ready for it. He
            blocks with his Keyblade, sending the orb back to the Opposite Armor, which begins to
            shake violently. The helmet falls inside its torso and a large glowing heart floats out
            into the sky, before the armor disappears. Sora walks over to the shining Keyhole, and
            locks it. The Keyhole shimmers and breaks off, disintegrating into pieces, leaving only
            the butterfly mural and a gummi block. Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to the First
            District and meet Cid behind the Accessory Shop</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Hey, now that was quick! Now you know. I’m in the gummi block
            business. Workin’ on your gummi ship sure was great. Come again and I’ll give you a big

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Yeah, please.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Hmm... Looks like this is another one of those blocks that come
            in sets. You gotta find the mate to this one.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He returns the gummi block to them and they enter the Accessory Shop, seeing a small

            <speaker>Pinocchio</speaker> It was a present.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jiminy</speaker> No fibbing, now! You know you’re not supposed to tell lies. A
            lie only grows and grows, ‘til you get caught! Plain as the nose on your face!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pinocchio</speaker> But if you want something, why wait? Why not just take
            it?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jiminy</speaker> Oh, my! Who told you that? You need some advice from your

        <sp>
            <speaker>Pinocchio</speaker> That’s right! You’re my conscience, Jiminy! I’ll never tell

            streets of Agrabah. They take out the Heartless as they make their way into an Alley.

            They move it off of the rug, who stands in front of them on two tassels and bows in

        <sp>
            <speaker>Aladdin</speaker> Say, Genie, what if I use my last wish to free you from the

        <sp>
            <speaker>Genie (smiling)</speaker> You’d do that?</sp>

            <speaker>Jafar (smirking)</speaker> So sorry, boy. I’m afraid your second wish has been

            which suddenly grows legs</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jafar</speaker> And now, I bid you all farewell. Attack!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Jafar disappears as two pots explode behind them, revealing the front and back of a
            Heartless. Sora attacks the front head, and its antennae light up with a burst of
            electricity. It swings them around wildly, striking Sora in the face. He reels back as
            Aladdin searches around for Jasmine, who is desperately calling out for help among the
            clay pots. Several of the numerous pots have grown legs and are walking around the area
            towards the large Heartless. Sora watches as the Pot Spiders join with the head and
            tail, becoming a Pot Centipede, which begins to walk toward the desert, gathering more
            Pot Spiders and growing bigger. Jasmine’s cries become fainter and they run after the
            Pot Centipede, searching for the princess within its body. As it races away from them,
            its tail bursts with darkness</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Courage!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He holds a hand to his heart, summoning with all his might. He gathers energy on the
            end of his Keyblade and thrusts it into the air, magic swirling around him. Up from the
            ground comes a large figure with glowing eyes. It steps forward and its golden fur and
            large mane come into view. The lion gives off a mighty roar, which fills the air. Simba
            jumps toward the Pot Centipede and bellows, sending various Pot Spiders shattering. When
            one pot is left, the Centipede gathers it up and starts to run faster. Aladdin races
            after it and with Sora’s help, the Pot Centipede is defeated. Aladdin runs at it, but it
            disappears, leaving nothing</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aladdin</speaker> Jasmine!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They hear an evil laugh emanating from the desert</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aladdin</speaker> To the desert! Come on, let’s move!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They take the Magic Carpet to the Desert. Suddenly, something bursts out of the sand,
            spinning violently toward them. It lands two giant feet on the ground, clawing at
            carpet, who dodges frantically as Sora grits his teeth. The four of them topple out of
            the carpet as Kurt Zisa turns its six-armed body in their direction, summoning two orbs
            of energy in its hands. The orb cancel their magic summoning abilities and Sora moves in
            to attack its feet. As it walks closer to them, the mechanical crunch echoing through
            the desert, it stares at them with its snake-like head. Two of its other arms hold long
            curved scythes, which is spins wildly, slicing at them. Sora and Aladdin eliminate the
            magic-cancelling orbs and Donald sends a Thunder spell, sending it falling to the
            ground. It’s head rears up out of its body on a long elastic neck, attempting to bite
            them, before it jumps back up, summoning large dust devils, tossing sand everywhere.
            Goofy charges it with his shield, but misses as it spins through the air toward Sora.
            Donald heals him as it sends fireballs toward them. With several more critical strikes,
            Kurt Zisa stumbles forward. They run away from it as its arms crash down in the sand
            around them. Aladdin summons the Magic Carpet and it swoops down to grab them as the
            Heartless falls over completely. A large glowing heart rises up into the sky as they fly
            away towards the end of the desert, watching as the Heartless vanishes in the distance.
            They reach the sandpit where they found Aladdin earlier and dismount from the carpet.
            They step forward and the sand in front of them lurches upward. The ground quakes as an
            enormous tiger head heaves out of the sand. Its mouth opens, heat and flame emanating
            from its depths, and its eyes glow. An evil glow, one of dark purpose. They approach its
            mouth before it reels upward, blasting them with a hot torrent of sand. Heartless appear
            and they realize the tiger head is under their control. Sora begins thrashing at the
            Heartless before a beam of energy strikes Aladdin in the back, knocking him over. Donald
            heals him and Sora sees that the beams are coming from its eyes. After he destroys a few
            Heartless, the tiger head buries its mouth in the sand, and Sora jumps onto its nose,
            because it releases a spray of sand from its mouth. Sora attacks its eyes before a
            Bandit Heartless flips onto the top of the tiger, almost knocking Sora off. Goofy climbs
            up the side of the tiger head and shields Sora from more flying Heartless. Sora
            continues striking the eyes until the power of darkness is driven from the Cave of
            Wonders. Once everything settles down, they enter the cave. Fighting Heartless through
            the labyrinthine halls of the Cave of Wonders, they drop down to a watery level and Sora
            destroys a pillar with a Fire spell. Meanwhile, in the Lamp Chamber, Jafar stands next
            to an enslaved Genie as Jasmine lies unconscious on the stone floor. Jafar taps his
            snake staff on the ground and holds up the magic lamp</desc>

        <desc>Genie looks over, despondently, and snaps his fingers. The rock wall bursts open,
            revealing pillars and a Keyhole beyond. Jafar cackles evilly. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and
            Aladdin make their way past the Treasure Room and into the Lamp Chamber, where they find
            Jafar speaking with Maleficent</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Jafar lifts his snake staff into the air, and its eyes glow, creating a magic barrier
            around the room, blocking the exit and the Keyhole. Jafar begins chanting a spell and he
            sends a beam of heat from his staff at them. Aladdin runs forward and attacks Jafar, who
            teleports to a platform on the other edge of the room as Genie floats toward them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Genie</speaker> I’m really sorry about this. Run!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He swipes at them, but they dodge his attacks and follow Jafar. Sora catches up and
            begins thrashing with his Keyblade, causing Genie to cheer. Jafar chants another spell,
            causing a giant hailstorm in the center of the room, trapping Donald and Goofy. Aladdin
            strikes from behind while Jafar is distracted and the vizier pulses with energy.
            Lightning crackles around him and he screams. Aladdin runs over to Jasmine, but before
            he can reach her, Jafar gets an idea</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jafar</speaker> Genie!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They turn to see Jafar floating in the center of the room, holding up the magic
            lamp</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jafar</speaker> My final wish! I want you to make me and all-powerful
            genie!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Genie covers his eyes and looks away, pointing his finger at Jafar and releasing as
            small amount of wish energy as possible. It strikes Jafar, who begins to glow and the
            floor crumbles beneath him, revealing a large pool of lava surrounding stone platforms.
            Jafar descends towards the pool and they stare down into the frightening, gaping maw.
            They jump down into the cavern, searching around for Jafar, when suddenly he bursts out
            of the lava with a great laugh. He gazes down at them evilly in his red genie form,
            brimming with power and malice. Iago flies by them, holding a coal black lamp</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aladdin</speaker> The lamp! Get Jafar’s lamp!</sp>
        <sp>

        <desc>The air is dense with heat, making it hard to breathe. They corner Iago on a faraway
            platform as Jafar rises up to meet them. Sora sends a Blizzara spell at him, but he
            shrugs it off</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Piglet</speaker> Really? B-But how?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> I shall hold on to the balloon, and fly like a bee up the Hunny
            Tree, see.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Piglet</speaker> But if you take their honey, won’t the bees be angry?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Hmm...</sp>

    <cutscene>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora walks over to them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> If you could only chase away those bees, I’m quite certain I
            could get a small morsel of honey. Would you help me get some honey?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Sure!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Owl lands on a branch above them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Oh. Hello there, Owl.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Good day, Pooh. What are you doing? Using a balloon to get some
            honey? Splendid idea! Allow me to offer a few pointers.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He flies to a higher branch</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Ahem! Now, Pooh can get honey by floating up this tree with his
            balloon. The honey is inside the tree hollows, not the beehives you see here.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He flies to an even higher branch</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> There’s quite a lot of honey in these holes. If Pooh gets too
            close, the bees will come out to protect their honey. If they get to Pooh, they’ll pop
            his balloon. Lock onto the bees and swat them away. The more time Pooh has at each
            hollow, the more honey he can eat. There’s more honey higher up, too. If jumping from
            branch to branch proves difficult, try the Rush command. Rush can help you catch up to
            Pooh quickly. But it isn’t fully reliable. Good luck.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora helps toss Pooh into the air and he floats up the tree, gathering honey. Sora
            swats away the bees that attack, letting Pooh enjoy his meal. Pooh grabs handfuls of
            honey in his mouth from inside the tree</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh (giggling)</speaker> It is rather funny what I will do for honey.</sp>

        <desc>It overtakes the ship and Sora’s life flashes before his eyes. He remembers a day, 9
            years ago, that he spent with Riku on the Destiny Islands. He walks down the stairs with
            Riku, his small hands folded behind his back</desc>

            tell you!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> All right. Suppose there really is a monster... Think we can
            beat it by ourselves, Sora?</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Just playing with Pinocchio.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> You know what I mean! What about Kairi? Did you find her?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Maybe. Catch us and maybe I’ll tell you what I know.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Why do you still care about that boy? He has all but
            deserted you for the Keyblade and his new companions, after all.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> I don’t care about him. I was just messing with him a
            little.</sp>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Riku! What’s the matter with you? What are you thinking? Don’t
            you realize what you’re doing?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> I was about to ask you the same thing, Sora. You only seem
            interested in running around and showing off that Keyblade these days. Do you even want
            to save Kairi?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I do.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Pinocchio screams and they run into the Bowels. They find him trapped inside a large
            Parasite Cage Heartless. It swings its appendages when they enter, waiting for them to

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora attacks the small head attached to its arms as it swings the arms wildly. Riku
            runs behind it to avoid them and strikes. Sora leaps at it, while Donald sends a Thunder
            spell, but it lifts an arm and Sora crashes into it, falling to the damp floor</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora attacks the bottom cage-like head of the Heartless where Pinocchio is trapped,
            but the beast will not budge. Its arms take out Goofy while Sora gives it an upward
            strike. It begins to wobble, grabbing the ceiling for balance, and spits out Pinocchio
            into a hole in the floor. Riku jumps in after him as the Heartless escapes. The water
            level in the mouth decreases as Sora, Donald, and Goofy land on the deck of Geppetto’s
            ship</desc>

            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Sorry, old man. I have some unfinished business with this
            puppet.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Geppetto</speaker> He’s no puppet! Pinocchio is my little boy!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> He is unusual. Not many puppets have hearts. I’m not sure, but
            maybe he can help someone who’s lost theirs.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Wait a minute. Are you talking about Kairi?</sp>
        <sp>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He walks toward Monstro’s throat. They go after him by climbing the piles of wood near
            the mouth. Sora finds another summon gem on top of one of them. They enter the throat
            and make their way to the stomach. Riku sets Pinocchio down on one of the platforms
            lining the walls as stomach acid pools on the floor</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> A puppet that’s lost its heart to the Heartless... Maybe it
            holds the key to helping Kairi. How about it, Sora? Let’s join forces to save her. We
            can do it, together.</sp>

            no heart?</sp>

        <desc>Jiminy jumps happily. Sora looks over to Donald and Goofy. Riku thinks for a second
            before looking up suddenly as the Parasite Cage falls from a hole in the ceiling. Riku
            makes a quick exit through a corridor of darkness, leaving them alone with the
            Heartless. Pinocchio runs out of the stomach and the Parasite Cage picks itself up on
            its arms and swings itself at Sora and company. Donald yells and sends a Thunder spell
            at it, while Sora runs up to it and begins striking its body with the Keyblade. The
            Parasite Cage begins swinging its arms again, but Goofy slams his shield into them,
            causing the Heartless to reel back. The top head falls backwards, causing the cage to
            open. It lies there, unconscious, while Sora continues to deal damage to it. It
            straightens up and begins swinging its arms again, knocking out Donald. The Heartless
            places its arms into the stomach acid, sucking it up through its appendages, and blowing
            it out through its mouth. Sora falls in pain Goofy falls unconscious. While the Parasite
            Cage continues swinging its arms madly, Sora uses Cure on both Donald and Goofy and the
            three of them move in unison. With a few more strikes, it flies backwards, a glowing
            heart coming out of its cage- like mouth and floating away. It begins to fall over,
            splashing acid everywhere</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> There are seven maidens of the purest heart. We call them
            the princesses of heart. Gather them together, and a door will open to the heart of all
            worlds. Within lies untold wisdom. There, you will surely find a way to recover Kairi’s

        <sp>
            <speaker>Piglet</speaker> Oh, wh-what to do?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> All this because he can’t stop liking honey so much! </sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora runs around to the back of the burrow, where Pooh’s head and arms are sticking
            out</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Oh, how will I eat honey if I’m stuck here? When it’s lunch
            time, perhaps you could bring me a honey jar.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> No honey ‘til you’re unstuck!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Rabbit runs in</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> If Pooh doesn’t slim down, my house will stay plugged up
            forever! If only there were something we could do...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He perks his head up, his ears pointed</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> Wait, I know! A bit of carrot top juice will do the trick! I
            have a carrot patch on the other side of the stream. Carrot top juice is just the ticket
            to slimming down a Pooh!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He turns toward his garden and shouts</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> Oh, no!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He runs ahead, Sora following. He sees a stuffed tiger bouncing into the area much to
            Rabbit’s dismay. The tiger jumps onto the bridge, destroying it, and bouncing over to
            Sora. Rabbit runs over to see the damage and lowers his ears. The tiger tackles Sora,
            knocking him over, laughing as his tail uncurls behind him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>??????</speaker> Hey, there! Name’s Tigger! T-I-double-guh-RR. That spells
            Tigger!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Tigger looks over Sora, standing on him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> Well, now! I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Hello, Tigger. You’ve just bounced my new friend Sora.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> Hey, Pooh! Say, you’re lookin’ mighty uncomfy today. Is that
            some new exercise? Why, bouncin’ around is a lot more fun.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He leaps off of Sora, who stands up, brushing the dirt off his clothes</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Wh-Why do you bounce around so much, Tigger?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> Why? ‘Cause bouncin’ is what Tiggers do best!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He puts a paw to his forehead and looks around</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> Speaking of which, my bouncin’ spot has gone and disappeared!
            So for now, this’ll be my new bouncin’ ground.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He laughs and bounces away towards Rabbit’s garden</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> Tigger’s bouncing will ruin my vegetables! And if we don’t
            give Pooh some carrot top juice, he’ll be stuck forever.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Rabbit turns to Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> Please help me! Keep Tigger away from my carrots!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> This is quite a fix. But I have just the solution. Pay attention,
            now.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Owl flies down to meet them. He takes Sora over to the carrot field</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Sora, you’ll have to protect this carrot patch. If Tigger bounces
            on a carrot twice, it’ll be buried.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He demonstrates jumping on a carrot</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Once...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He jumps again</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Twice!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He flies back off the carrot</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Just like that. Protect the carrots from Tigger’s bounces and
            you’ll receive points. How you ask? It’s elementary!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He swings out a wing</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Simply get to the carrots before Tigger lands on them. There are
            fifteen carrots here. Your score depends on how many you save, and how many times you
            block Tigger. Oh, and one more thing.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He flies over to Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> The Rush command is the key to a high score. Select Rush while
            near a carrot that isn’t buried yet. You’ll dash to the target area before Tigger lands.
            Well, good luck!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Tigger bounces over and Sora protects the carrots from him. Tigger dances
            around</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> How about those bounceroonies? They were good even for a
            Tigger.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He laughs and bounces away</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> Thank you so much. Now I’d better make that carrot top juice.
            I’ll get the carrots, so please wait inside the house.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora enters the house. Later, Rabbit returns</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> Oh, what a day! I gave Pooh the carrot top juice. All we have
            to do now is push him out. Just a little push should do.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora runs and tackles Pooh out of the wall, sending him flying into a pile of honey
            pots. Piglet covers his eyes while Rabbit is in shock</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> First my vegetable patch and now this...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Pooh sits up, a honey pot stuck over his head</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Oh, bother. Where am I? It’s ever so dark in here. Well, it
            isn’t so bad, I suppose. There is plenty of honey.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He laughs and Sora regroups with Donald and Goofy in Merlin’s Study. They leave
            Traverse Town and compete in the Pegasus Cup at the Olympus Coliseum. After making their
            way through the tournament, they speak to Phil and Hercules</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Hercules</speaker> That was great! Looks like Phil’s trained another great
            hero!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Is strength the most important part of a hero?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> Well, what you really need is a strong heart. What makes
            a strong heart? If you have to ask, you’re not a hero yet!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Stop talking in riddles!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> It’s not a riddle!</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>They travel to Atlantica</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Okay, guys. Prepare for landing.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Land where? In the sea? We’ll drown!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Not with my magic, we won’t. Just leave it to me.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Under the water, fish scurry away as Sora, Donald, and Goofy appear in a flurry of
            bubbles. They inspect their new aquatic bodies. Sora has the tail of a dolphin, while
            Donald and Goofy are an octopus and a sea turtle, respectively. They swim around for a
            while, getting used to being underwater, before a mermaid and a small fish swim towards
            the alcove, followed by a red crab</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> Come on, Sebastian!</sp>
        <sp>

            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Relax, Sebastian. They don’t look like one of them. Right,
            Flounder?</sp>

        <desc>She looks down to her fishy friend, who’s hiding behind her</desc>

        <desc>She swims around him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> They do seem... a little different. Where are you from?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (nervous)</speaker> We’re from kind of far away. And we’re not really used
            to these waters.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Goofy has a staring contest with Flounder. Sora continues to laugh nervously, not sure

            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Oh, I see. In that case... Sebastian can show you how we swim
            around here.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sebstian</speaker> Easy for you to say... Okay, it’s time you learn how to swim
            properly. Practice swimming with Flounder. Try to tag him. All right. Begin.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora plays tag with Flounder until he gets the hang of swimming</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sebastian</speaker> Good job. Now let’s move onto self-defense.</sp>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He looks over to Ariel, who is pointing to the Heartless swimming towards them from

        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Those creatures chased us here.</sp>

            too!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> We’d better head back right away!</sp>

        <desc>She looks over at the trio</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> I’m sorry, but we need your help. Please come to the palace
            with us. The trident markers on the walls point the way there. We won’t get lost as long
            as we follow them. Okay, let’s get going.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They swim to King Triton’s Palace, pursued by Heartless. As they enter the Throne
            Room, a bolt of lightning obliterates the Heartless</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> That was too close. As long as I have my trident, I will not
            tolerate those creatures inside this palace.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sebastian (clearing his throat)</speaker> Behold. You swim before the ruler of
            the seas: His Majesty, King Triton.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> And who are they?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> They helped us fight off those creatures.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton (warily)</speaker> They don’t look familiar.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> We’re from an ocean very far away.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy (swimming around)</speaker> Yup. We came to find the Keyhole.</sp>
        <sp>

            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> What’s that?</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton (angrily)</speaker> There’s no such thing! Certainly not here!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> But, Daddy...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> Ariel, not another word! You are not to leave the palace. Is
            that clear?</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>She scowls at him and swims away. Sora, Donald and Goofy swim after her. Triton

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He watches them swim away</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sebastian</speaker> Of course, Your Majesty. But I must admit, now I’m quite
            curious about this Keyhole.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> That need not concern you, Sebastian. Have you anything to
            report?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sebastian</speaker> Just as you suspected, Your Majesty, they seem to be coming
            from Ursula’s grotto.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> I knew it. That sea witch is up to no good again.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sebastian</speaker> Yes, she poses serious danger.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton (sternly)</speaker> And I told you to keep Ariel away from such danger,
            did I not?</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> No. Not at all. I used to feel the same way.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Used to?</sp>

            <speaker>Flounder</speaker> There’s this really big fish who can swim against the
            current. But he’s scared of those weird things swimming around. So if we chase them
            away, I think the big fish’ll play with us. Maybe if you grab onto him, he’ll take you
            somewhere.</sp>

        <desc>She cackles loudly. Meanwhile, Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Ariel find a dolphin swimming
            in the Calm Depths. After eliminating the Heartless in the area, the dolphin lets them
            ride it through the rough current to a large area with a Sunken Ship. They enter the
            ship and an ominous shape swims in the waters above. Once they reach a stateroom inside
            the sunken ship a huge shark crashes through the window, attempting to bite them. It is
            unable to swim inside the shape due to its size, so it swims away and waits for them to
            leave. Inside the ship they find a crystal trident inside a treasure chest</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Hm. Its shape reminds me of something...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They leave the ship, where Glut is waiting for them. After a persuasive battle, the
            shark gives up and swims away. They return to Ariel’s Grotto and place the crystal
            trident in the rocky impression</desc>

        <desc>He sees the crystal trident and is filled with anger. He raises his trident, which

    <cutscene>
        <desc>She swims away from him and he turns his eyes on Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> Young man, you’re not from another ocean. You’re from another
            world. Aren’t you?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (surprised)</speaker> Huh?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> Then you must be the key bearer.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> How did you know?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> You may fool Ariel, but you can’t fool me. You don’t know your
            dorsal fin from your tail.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Aw...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> As the key bearer, you must already know... One must not
            meddle in the affairs of other worlds.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Of course I know that, but...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> You have violated this principle. The key bearer shatters
            peace and brings ruin.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Aw, Sora’s not like that.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> I thank you for saving my daughter. But there is no room in my

        <sp>
            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> It’s all right. Helping others is what I live for. Let me
            guess. You wish to see other worlds. That shouldn’t be too hard. After all, your new
            friends came from another world.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> What?</sp>

            journey—to the dark world of the Heartless!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Flotsam</speaker> We cannot find the Keyhole.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Wait, I’m going with you! My father is hurt and it’s all my

            <speaker>Sebastian</speaker> That’s right. I’m right behind you, Ariel.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> Ursula draws power from her cauldron. To defeat Ursula, you
            must strike her cauldron with magic.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They return to the Sunken Ship area and find a large stone with the marking of a sea
            monster. Behind a sunken lifeboat nearby, there is an something embedded in the wall.
            Sora is unable to reach it</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What is that thing?</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sebastian swims between the lifeboat and the wall and pushes the small rock in the
            wall, causing the large leviathan rock to sink into the ocean floor. They enter the Den
            of Tides and follow it to Ursula’s Lair. Ursula crawls out of her shell be,
            scowling</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Come out! You can’t run!</sp>

            <speaker>Sebastian</speaker> Your time has come!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She swims toward them giving them a frightening look, scaring Sebastian and Donald.
            She tosses a potion into her cauldron, which starts to glow. Goofy and Ariel start
            fighting off Flotsam and Jetsam while Sora and Donald strike her cauldron with
            magic</desc>

        <desc>Goofy and Ariel knock Flotsam and Jetsam unconscious and Sora sends a Thunder spell at
            Ursula’s cauldron, which ignites its contents, sending a burst of magic spilling out in
            all directions. Ursula is knocked out temporarily and Sora attacks with his Keyblade.
            Soon Ursula regains consciousness</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> Get up and fight!</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>She heals Flotsam and Jetsam and begins cackling, spinning wildly in the water. Donald
            casts an Aero spell on everyone to shield them from her whirling tentacles. Sora starts
            striking her cauldron until it explodes again onto Ursula</desc>

            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> No... Impossible!</sp>

        <desc>The foiled magic disintegrates Flotsam and Jetsam, to Ursula’s horror and she swims

            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> You’ll pay for this!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Let’s go. We must get the trident back.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>She teaches them Mermaid Kick and they catch up to Ursula in the Open Ocean</desc>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She brandishes the trident and spins upwards. A wave of ink and darkness emanates from
            below as she begins growing to an immense size. A crown appears on her head and she
            towers over them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They swim upward to escape from her crushing tentacles and she stares down at them
            with crazed eyes</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> Hey, you. Not so fast! Get ready for this!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She spits out disorienting bubbles at them, which stop them for a second, but they
            swim straight at her and begin pummeling away. Suddenly, the current changes and Sora
            feels himself being swept upward towards her mouth. He swims away frantically as Ariel
            and Donald attack from behind. He manages to get away just as she bites down</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> Hmph... Slippery little morsel.</sp>

        <desc>Lightning strikes around them, a defense mechanism, as they attack her directly</desc>

            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> You dare to strike me!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She summons an energy beam which she aims at Sora, who begins swimming around her to
            dodge it, but she continues circling, unwilling to let him escape. She catches her
            breath after the intense beam leaves her defenseless. Donald and Ariel continue
            attacking her head while Goofy goes for her hand, which is still clutching the trident.
            She gathers strength again and lifts the trident high</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ursula</speaker> This won’t be pretty!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Several lightning bolts attack the water around them, almost knocking them all out.
            Ursula, at her wit’s end, begins inhaling water, dragging Sora toward her. Instead of
            swimming away, he uses this to propel himself toward her and tackles her with the
            Keyblade right into her throat. She tries to scream, holding her hands to her throat as
            the water around her crackles with energy. She begins flailing and disappears in a
            flurry of darkness, leaving only the trident floating in a beam of light. They return to
            the Throne Room and speak to King Triton</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Daddy, I’m so sorry.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Please don’t be angry with her.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> It’s my fault. You followed Ursula because... I wouldn’t let
            you follow your heart. And when you found that crystal, I lost my temper and destroyed
            it.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Oh, yeah, the crystal! Why did you destroy it?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> The crystal held the power to reveal the Keyhole. The Keyhole
            is dangerous. I had to keep you away from it at any cost.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Daddy...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> Key bearer, I have one more request: Seal the Keyhole. My
            trident also holds the power to reveal the Keyhole. Will you do it?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Of course. That’s what we had in mind from the start.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Where is the Keyhole, Daddy?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> You should know better than anyone. It’s in your grotto.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Really... Sora, let’s go.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They return to Ariel’s Grotto and Ariel uses the trident to reveal the Keyhole. Sora
            aims his Keyblade at it and seals it. Ariel floats over to him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Tell me, Sora. Your world, what’s it like?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Oh, about that... Sorry for lying to you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel (smiling)</speaker> It’s okay. Besides, if you can travel to other
            worlds, maybe I can, too.</sp>

        <desc>She swims upwards in a spiral, looking towards the surface</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> So many places I want to see... I know I’ll get there someday.
            I’ll find a way somehow. I’m sure of it.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sebastian (sighing)</speaker> Well, if you find it, do me a favor and leave me
            out of it.</sp>
        <sp>

            time. It’s not much of a tail, though I’m sort of attached to it. But I don’t know why
            anybody’d look for it. Probably won’t find it anyway...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Sora, why don’t we all look for Eeyore’s tail?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Lost something?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Owl flies in from above</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Searching from a high place is the quickest way to find it!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Owl, can you fly up high and help us find Eeyore’s tail?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Sorry, but my eyes aren’t what they used to be. Too much reading,
            you know. But I can offer good advice! Of course, you don’t have to if you don’t want
            to. See that swing up there? Take Pooh there.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He motions toward the tree at the top of a hill</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> You’re a bit too big for the swing, but Pooh should fit nicely.
            I’ll tell you more when you get there.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He flies away. Sora leads Pooh up the hill to the swing, where Owl is perched on the
            branch above them. Pooh gets on the swing</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Here’s what to do. First, get ready to push.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> How?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Like this.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Owl demonstrates</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Like this?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora pushes the swing gently</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> How’s this?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Not bad, not bad! Here’s the next step. If you time it right,
            Pooh will swing higher and higher. Try it! Push too soon, Pooh won’t go any higher. Push
            too late, he’ll go too high.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>With Owl’s help, Sora pushes Pooh on the swing, tossing him into the air so he can
            search for Eeyore’s tail from high above. He lands right in front of Rabbit on a house
            made of sticks, knocking Eeyore over. Pooh stands up and Eeyore sees something under the
            pile of sticks</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Eeyore</speaker> Hm? That looks familiar...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora repins Eeyore’s tail onto him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> How’s it looking?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> There we go.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Eeyore swings his tail around</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Eeyore</speaker> It’s not much of a tail, but it’s mine. Thanks, everyone.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> I wish we could put the Hundred Acre Wood back the way it was,
            too!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Owl sits on the branch of the tree, waving a wing. Pooh’s words make Sora more
            determined to find the rest of the book’s torn pages. Sora leaves the hill and finds
            Pooh at his house, sitting on a log outside</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh (shivering)</speaker> Brrr! I think I spend too much time on the
            swing.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora targets the pile of sticks in front of them and ignites them into a small fire.
            Pooh extends his hands to warm them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Thank you, Sora. This is nice and warm. You’ve helped us so
            much. This is just something to say thank you.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Pooh hops off the log and gives Sora a Mythril stone. Sora leaves the 100 Acre Wood
            and the three travel to a dark world filled with pumpkins and ghosts. Donald changes
            their outfits so they blend in with the eerie scenery</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> This sure is a spooky place. I’ll bet the people here are
            scary- lookin’ too.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Don’t worry. We look spooky, too. If they scare us, we’ll
            scare them right back!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> You think so?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They enter the Town Square and an explosion goes off in a nearby laboratory, sending
            smoke into the air. They see a group of Search Ghost Heartless in town, but they don’t
            attack. Sora makes his way over to the laboratory when they hear a booming voice</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> And now, allow me to introduce...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They look over to see a short man in an extremely tall hat speaking through a
            megaphone. He wears a spider as a bow tie and a ribbon reading <q>Mayor</q> is attached
            to his business suit. From their angle, it looked like he had a second face behind his
            head</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Mayor</speaker> The master of terror... the king of nightmares—Jack

    <cutscene>
        <desc>The line of Search Ghosts part as they present the fountain in the middle of the
            square, where a tall, thin figure was emerging from the green water. He had a black and
            white striped outfit and long bony fingers. His head was naught but a skull; behind his
            eyes, only blackness. He strikes a pose and smiles, and the Mayor runs over to
            him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Mayor</speaker> Bravo, Jack! Bravo! Those ghosts will be a big hit at this
            year’s Halloween!</sp>

        <desc>The Mayor grins wildly as Jack steps out from the fountain</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> Thank you, thank you! But their movement still needs work. It’s
            not scary enough.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He hangs his head</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> I want to strike bone-chilling terror.</sp>

        <desc>He lifts his arms in a creepy pose, and the Mayor backs up</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> I’m going to consult the doctor.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He runs away gleefully. So gleefully, in fact, that he runs in the wrong direction and
            has to turn around. Sora, Donald, and Goofy follow Jack to Doctor Finkelstein’s research
            lab, where the doctor is inspecting the Heartless on the examination table from the
            comfort of his wheelchair. The various machines on the walls gurgle and hiss</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> I don’t understand. Maybe the guidance system was damaged in the
            explosion.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Finkelstein</speaker> Nonsense. My devices are always perfect!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Jack searches through the doctor’s research book</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> Oh, I’ve got it! Why, of course! The Heartless need a heart!
            Doctor, do you think we can add a heart to that device?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Finkelstein</speaker> Certainly. A heart’s not all that complicated.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He rides his motorized wheelchair to the end of the table</desc>
        <sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Finkelstein</speaker> We need the key to this thing first!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> You’re really gonna unlock it for them?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Why not? If they succeed, we won’t have to fight the Heartless,
            right? Besides, I want to see the Heartless dance, too. Don’t you?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Not really.</sp>

            <speaker>Jack</speaker> Well done, Sora! I’d like you to be a part of this year’s
            Halloween.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (pointing)</speaker> What’s this Heartless doing here?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> Oh, the Heartless came to town just recently. What’s frustrating
            is I can’t get them to dance with me. So the doctor and I are trying to improve the
            guidance system. He’s quite a genius! Okay, Doctor, let’s continue. The ingredients for
            a heart: Pulse.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> Mix them all together, and we have a heart!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The doctor completes this and places the heart into the console of the machine. He
            wheels over to a large lever and initiates the experiment. The machine sparks to life,
            gears clicking and whirling. Electricity crackles over the Heartless, who suddenly sits
            up with its arms outstretched, before falling limp</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Finkelstein</speaker> It failed!</sp>

        <desc>He slams his fists on the arms of his wheelchair and closes his skull. He whirls

        <sp>
            <speaker>Finkelstein</speaker> Sally’s got the memory we need. See if you can track her
            down.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack (patting his chest)</speaker> No problem. Sora, would you like to come

        <sp>

            reconsider... I’m happy if he’s happy, but I’m just so worried about him. I’m worried
            about him because I...well, I just am. Jack, why not have these kids star in the
            festival instead? They both look rather frightful. And funny, too. They’d be better than

            <speaker>Finkelstein</speaker> Yes. This is it. Now, just one more ingredient. We need

        <desc>Meanwhile, Lock, Shock, and Barrel are trembling in the presence of a laughing monster
            named Oogie Boogie. He has the appearance of a burlap sack tied together with thread.
            Two holes for the eyes curve evilly, giving him a nightmarish look. His hands and feet
            end in points, rather than fingers, and an opening in the cloth is stitched together for
            the mouth</desc>
        <sp>

        <desc>Finkelstein yells as he falls out of his chair, causing the heart to bounce over the

            snickers and the three escape</desc>

        <desc>Zero flies towards the Graveyard to Moonlight Hill, where a large curled hill unfurls,
            making a pathway to a bridge. Lock, Shock, and Barrel ride in a walking bathtub over the
            hill. Sora and company arrive and defeat the Heartless in the area. They find a hidden
            switch in a gravestone, which unfurls the hill for them and they walks across to the
            bridge to Oogie’s Manor, where the bathtub is approaching a wooden bridge. Sora, Donald,
            Goofy, and Jack run in</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>They stare up towards the twisted mansion. They make their way up the mansion,
            fighting Heartless until they find the topmost room. They enter the Evil Playroom to
            find Lock, Shock, and Barrel tossing the heart down a shaft. They whirl around when they
            enter. Sora and company subdue the three imps and force them to talk</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Shock</speaker> We were just following orders! Oogie Boogie told us to steal
            the heart. It’s all Barrels fault! It was his idea to tell Oogie Boogie about the
            heart.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Lock</speaker> Yeah, that’s right!</sp>

            <speaker>Shock</speaker> You should be ashamed!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Lock</speaker> Oogie Boogie made us do it. We had no choice.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Barrel</speaker> Oogie Boogie told us not to give away his hiding place. Oh,
            and we’re not supposed to talk about the lever, either.</sp>

        <desc>Sora activates a lever on a control panel and gears in the wall begin to spin</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Barrel</speaker> What’s he going to do with the heart? Beats me. I’d stay away
            from Oogie Boogie if I were you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Shock</speaker> Hey, I was just following Oogie Boogie’s orders! We don’t have
            the heart! Oogie Boogie has it!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Lock</speaker> There’s no way I’m gonna take you to him! If I did that, Oogie
            Boogie would eat us too.</sp>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They make their way down to Oogie’s Torture Chamber, which looks like a giant roulette

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He pulls a switch causing an explosion from behind Sora and company, knocking them
            into the pit of the roulette wheel. The Heartless fly down and attack them, but they are
            quickly defeated</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Oogie Boogie</speaker> C’mon, baby!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Oogie, being a gambling man, throws exploding dice into the pit, but they dodge out of
            the way. Sora activates a switch that raises his section of the pit, allowing him access
            to the boogeyman. Sora holds a hand to his chest and raises his Keyblade, which lights
            up and a bubble drops down from above. The bubble pops, revealing a young elephant with
            enormous ears. Sora jumps onto Dumbo, grabbing onto the elephant’s hat. Dumbo flies into
            the air with his huge ears and sprays a torrent of water at Oogie Boogie. Once the
            boogeyman has had enough of this, he activates an explosion. Dumbo disappears and Sora
            is sent back into the pit. Donald attempts to strike Oogie from below with Thunder and
            Gravity spells</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Oogie Boogie</speaker> Bone Soldiers!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The eys of the slot machines glow and they raise their pistols, shooting at the three
            of them. They jump out of the way onto another button that sends all four of them upward
            to face Oogie. They attack Oogie Boogie with everything they have, causing the villain’s
            burlap sack to open and a swarm of squirming bugs to fall all over the floor. Oogie
            Boogie screams before the sack falls motionless with the heart still inside as a final
            blue bug crawls out of it. It lands on its back, squirming on the floor of the
            pit</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> So, that heart was a failure after all.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They leave Oogie’s Manor, crossing the wooden bridge back to the ridge they entered
            from, when a large explosion occurs behind them, sending everyone off balance</desc>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Dust billows out from the mansion and they hear Oogie Boogie moaning. When the dust
            settles, they see his body overtaking the house, covered in orb of darkness</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Whoa! How did he get so big?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> Look! It’s brimming with the power of darkness! Oogie Boogie is
            drawing power from those dark globs!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> So we just have to destroy those things, right?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The four jump down as the bridge is now destroyed and make their way up the living
            mansion, destroying the dark orbs in their path. After the final one is taken out, the
            mansion quakes and crumbles to the ground. In its place a giant Keyhole appears. Sora
            sends a beam of light into the air, which breaks up and falls on the Keyhole, locking
            it. They return to Dr. Finkelstein’s Lab, where Sally is waiting for them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jack</speaker> Sally, why didn’t I listen to you?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sally</speaker> Don’t feel bad, Jack. We’ll come up with another plan for

        <desc>He takes her by the wings and holds her over Sora, Donald, and Goofy, sprinkling
            magical dust on them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> Just a little bit of pixie dust. There. Now you can
            fly.</sp>

        <desc>Donald jumps into the air, swinging his arms up and down, but he falls to the floor.
            Tinker Bell flies down and laughs at him, as he taps his finger on the floor. Meanwhile,
            Riku is in the Captain’s Hold talking to Captain Hook</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> What? So Wendy’s not one of the chosen ones?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> There are seven, supposedly, and Maleficent says she’s not one
            of them.</sp>

        <desc>He faces the door</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Hoist anchor as soon as possible. Leave all the dead weight
            behind, including her.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> After the trouble of capturing her? And why those seven?
            What is Maleficent planning, anyway?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Who knows? As long as it means getting Kairi’s heart back, I
            couldn’t care less.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> You’re wasting your time! The Heartless has devoured
            that girl’s heart. I’ll stake me other hand it’s lost forever.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> I will find it no matter what.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Smee</speaker> Uh, Captain...</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> What?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Smee</speaker> The prisoners have escaped. What’s more, Peter Pan is with
            them.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Hook (annoyed)</speaker> Blast that Peter Pan! All right, then! Bring the

    <cutscene>
        <desc>A young girl in a blue dress is sitting on her cot in the room above. There is a grate
            in the floor with which to see and hear through. She turns her head towards the

        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> Peter? Peter Pan?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She stands up cordially and rushes to the grate in the floor, kneeling</desc>

            <speaker>Wendy</speaker> Yes?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Is there another girl in there with you?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She looks up at Kairi, who’s still sitting limp on the floor</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Wendy</speaker> Oh, why, yes. But she seems to be asleep. She hasn’t budged an
            inch.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Kairi? Kairi!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora can see part of Kairi’s leg through the grate. Her arm falls next to her with the
            movement of the ship. He holds out a hand with a sad, but hopeful face. Wendy stands up
            and grabs hold of a dresser. Kairi’s fingers twitch, putting a smile on Sora’s face. The
            door opens and Kairi is dragged away. Wendy cries out as she is taken away and the door
            shuts</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> Wendy! Hey, let’s get up there!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They reach a higher level of the ship in the hall where Wendy’s cabin is. Peter Pan
            bangs on the locked door</desc>

            <speaker>Peter Pan (calling)</speaker> Wendy, are you in there?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They enter another door into a room with a ladder. They climb up to the Captain’s
            Hold. Sora runs ahead and sees Riku</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Riku, wait!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Riku holds Kairi in his arms as a shadow flows in from under the door behind him. Riku
            backs away towards the door and the shadow leaps out of the floor. It looks just like
            Sora, staring eerily with glowing eyes. Riku escapes and the shadow crawls along the
            floor underfoot. Jumping up at Sora, striking him with a dark duplicate of the Keyblade.
            It moves like Sora, attacking and deflecting blows just the same. Sora goes after it,
            but it sinks back into the floor, splitting into three copies. The room crowded, Peter
            Pan flies forward striking them with his shadow and giving a loud crow. He destroys two
            of the shadows, leaving the real one at the mercy of his blade. Antisora vanishes into a
            burst of darkness and turns invisible. Catching Sora offguard, he swipes at him in the
            air, visible for only a second, before disappearing. Antisora makes no sound due to its
            status as a shadow, so they don’t have the help of following its footfalls. Donald
            attempts to bring it out with Thunder spells, but it wears him out and comes up empty.
            It strikes at Peter Pan, but Goofy’s shield blocks it. Sora uses Strike Raid, tossing
            his Keyblade through the room. It flies through the air, spinning wildly until it makes
            contact with Antisora, who freezes on the spot, it’s darkness dripping to the floor. It
            stands there motionless like a statue before falling into the dark pool. Sora’s shadow
            returns to him and they drop down through the floor into Wendy’s room. They find her
            laying on the floor with her eyes closed. Peter Pan floats down next to her and picks
            her head up</desc>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He waves her off and she flies away</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> Well, this is as far as I can go. I’ve gotta help
            Wendy.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He picks her up and flies out of the room, leaving Sora, Donald, and Goofy by
            themselves. They return to the Captain’s Hold and takes the doorway to the Main Deck,
            where they find Captain Hook and his army of Heartless</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> Quite a codfish, that Riku—running off with that girl
            without even saying goodbye.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He waves in the air</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Run off where? Tell me, where did he go?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He swipes at the air with his Keyblade</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> To the ruins of Hollow Bastion, where Maleficent
            resides. But you won’t be going there.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He takes an unlit lantern from Mr. Smee, holding it up. Tinker Bell is trapped inside
            with her hands on the glass. Sora gasps</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> Unless you intend to leave your little pixie friend
            behind?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He holds his hook up to the lantern scraping the glass with it, scaring Tinker Bell.
            Sora sighs in exasperation, dispelling the Keyblade. The Pirate Heartless surround them,
            knives bared</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> Hand over the Keyblade and I’ll spare your lives. Be
            glad I’m merciful, unlike the Heartless. So, which will it be? The Keyblade, or the
            plank?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He points his hook in the direction of the plank, a wooden board hoisted off the side
            of the deck. He hears a sound in the air and looks to see a sharp-toothed crocodile in
            the water, the clock inside its belly ticking away</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook (terrified)</speaker> It’s him! The crocodile that took me hand!
            Oh, Smee! He’s after me other hand! I can’t stay here!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>It stares up at him hungrily</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> Go away! Oh, I can’t stand the sight of him!</sp>
    </cutscene>

        <desc>Hook retreats to his cabin</desc>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The Pirate Heartless force Sora onto the plank, who backs slowly towards the ocean.
            When he reaches the edge of the plank, the crocodile opens its wide mouth and Sora hears
            Peter Pan’s voice</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> Fly, Sora! Just believe, and you can do it!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora closes his eyes and leaps backwards off the plank. He descends toward the
            crocodile, who jumps at him, but at the last second flies into the air over the deck.
            Peter Pan swoops down and takes Tinker Bell from Smee, who is distracted by Sora. Sora
            and Peter Pan land on the deck in front of the flabbergasted first mate. Peter Pan opens
            the lantern, setting Tinker Bell free</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Thanks, Peter.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> Hey, don’t mention it. You didn’t think I’d leave you and
            Tink behind, did you?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Tinker Bell floats down next to them and Smee runs away, leaving them to deal with the
            Heartless swarming the deck</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> You’re all going down!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They start attacking the Heartless on the ship and in the air. Sora holds a hand to
            his chest and the Keyblade flashes. He throws it into the air and catches it. Magic
            sparks burst out of the tip of the blade uncontrollably and he loses his grip on it. In
            a final burst of magic, it creates blue smoke which billows upward. Genie appears inside
            the smoke with a huge grin on his face. He yells and flexes his muscles, spinning around
            and giving Sora a high five. Genie targets the surrounding Heartless and shoots them
            with several magic spells</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Genie</speaker> Toodle-oo!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He waves and disappears. Once the Heartless are taken care of, Sora and Peter Pan wait
            outside the Captain’s Hold. Peter knocks on the door with a devilish grin</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> Is that you, Smee? Did you finish them off?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Peter laughs silently to himself and pinches his nose to sound like Smee</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan (as Smee)</speaker> Aye, Captain. They walked the plank, every last
            one of them.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Captain Hook runs out past them and looks around, seeing nobody there, before Peter
            Pan pokes him with his dagger. Hook shout and jumps into the air, stumbling over his
            words</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook</speaker> P-Peter Pa—blast you!</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He points toward Hook. Battleship Heartless appear in the air, raining down cannon
            fire on them. Donald and Goofy fly in the air after the Heartless while Sora and Peter
            Pan go after Hook, who slashes in the air frantically at them</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Hook throws a box at Sora, which exploded in his face as Peter Pan charges at him with
            his dagger. Hook blocks and knocks Peter back</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Captain Hook (mockingly)</speaker> Come and get me!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora slides towards him and attempts to strike with the Keyblade, but Hook jumps back
            near the rudder. Sora flies up and after him. He sends a Fira spell at the Captain,
            which sets his trousers on fire, causing him to run around hysterically. He runs over
            the guardrail of the top deck, and Peter Pan knocks him into the water, making a big
            splash. He surfaces in front of the crocodile, who opens his mouth happily, his tongue
            lolling about as he pounces at Captain Hook. The captain runs on the water, screaming,
            as the crocodile chases him out of sight. Later, Sora stands at the guardrail away from
            Donald, Goofy, and Peter</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Uh, Kairi couldn’t wake up, so maybe she’s really lost

        <desc>He looks into the night sky, smiling</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I really flew. Wait ‘til I tell Kairi. I wonder if she’ll
            believe me. Probably not.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> You can bring her to Never Land sometime. Then she can try
            it herself.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> If you believe, you can do anything, right? I’ll find Kairi. I
            know I will. There’s so much I want to tell her—about flying, the pirates, and
            everything else that’s happened.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Tinker Bell flies in and speaks to Peter</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> What’s that, Tink? What about the clock tower? You say
            there’s something there?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They fly off the ship away from Never Land to a quaint city where the moon is shining
            brightly over the large clock tower. The tower has four faces, a clock on each side. As
            they approach, a cloaked Heartless flies alongside them. Sora looks over and it stares
            at him beneath its hood, darkness trailing in the air behind it. They stop and it faces
            them in front of the tower, gathering magic in its fingers. The numbers of the clock
            start to glow and the minute hand begins to move forward. Donald sees this and quickly
            casts stop on the clock. The Phantom Heartless swoops forward and attempts to claw at
            Sora with its sharp fingers. A bright orb of magical energy appears at the base of the
            Heartless’s cloak. Sora strikes it with his Keyblade and it turned red in color. Donald
            shoots a Fira spell at it and it turns blue. Smiling, Donald aims a Blizzara spell, and
            the orb disappears. The Phantom recoils, enraged. It spins around and releases a dark
            fireball. Sora tries to fly away but it strikes him in the back. Goofy tosses him a
            Potion and they continue their magic strategy until the Phantom begins to falter in the
            air. Its hands cover its stomach, bending over in front of the clock. From beneath its
            cloak, a heart floats out, and the Phantom falls and fades away. Wendy sits at the clock
            tower as they fly towards her. She stands up as they land. Soon, the clock strikes
            midnight and the Keyhole appears, shining bright enough to be seen from a distance,
            flashing between the 2 and 3 on the clock. Sora aims his Keyblade at it and locks it. It
            glows and disappears, releasing a gummi block. Meanwhile in Hollow Bastion, Riku’s
            memories flash through his mind. He recalls the day nearly 9 years ago when he and Sora
            discovered the Secret Place</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Hey, Sora.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (looking back at him)</speaker> Hm?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real
            adventures, not this kid stuff!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Riku’s eyes grow wide with anticipation</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the
            new girl at the mayor’s house? She arrived on the night of the meteor shower!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora exits the cave, and Riku follows him, before stopping to look back at the wooden
            door. A golden Keyhole has appeared on the door and he stares at it in fascination. Riku
            snaps back into reality, a light from the ceiling casting its glow on him. He is
            kneeling on the floor, entirely out of breath. He breathes heavily as green torches burn
            on the walls. Maleficent stands over him, holding her staff strongly, looking down on
            him with dominating eyes</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent (deriding)</speaker> It was reckless to bring her here without at
            least using a vessel. Remember, relying too heavily on the dark powers could cost you
            your heart.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>A booming roar resounds from outside the castle, causing Riku to stand and look toward
            the source of the noise. Maleficent smiles</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> A castaway.</sp>

            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Though his world perished, his heart did not. When we took
            the princess from his castle, he apparently followed her here through sheer force of
            will. But fear not. No harm will come to you. He is no match for your power.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> My power?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Yes, the untapped power that lies within you. Now, child,
            it’s time you awakened that power and realized your true potential.</sp>

        <desc>A green aura surrounds Riku and he feels stronger. Meanwhile, Wendy walks along the

        <sp>
            <speaker>Wendy</speaker> Peter, are you really going back to Never Land?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> Afraid so. But we can see each other any time. As long as
            you don’t forget about Never Land, that is.</sp>

        <desc>He floats closer and they hold hands. Tinker Bell sees this and crosses her arms in
            jealousy. Donald laughs at her until she turns around and glares at him. He clamps his
            beak shut and the pixie flies over to Peter and Wendy, spinning angry circles around
            them. Then she does the same to Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Peter Pan</speaker> Oh, boy. She’s getting’ steamed again. Do me a favor. Look
            after her for me, will ya?</sp>

        <desc>Sora talks to Wendy</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Wendy</speaker> Peter remains with me as long as I remember him. You will find
            Kairi if she remains in your heart. You’ll find her Sora. Just don’t give up.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Geppetto</speaker> Well, hello, Sora!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> How did you get here?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Geppetto</speaker> A man named Leon helped us. He even got us this house to
            live in. I don’t know how I’ll ever repay his kindness. Say, I hear you three are
            fighting the Heartless. I thought I might be able to help you, so I made this.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Geppetto</speaker> But of course! Pinocchio and I can’t thank you enough! We’ll
            do anything we can to help you.</sp>
        <sp>

            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Sora!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Now, just remember what Donald said to ya: no frowning, no sad
            faces.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> How can you be so cheerful? There’s still no sign of your king.
            Aren’t you worried?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Aw, phooey.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> The king told us to go out and find the key bearer, and we
            found you. So as long as we stick together, it’ll all work out okay. Ya just gotta
            believe in yourself, that’s all.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Just believe...</sp>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora finds himself flying toward a great shining light, which envelops everything.
            Slowly, a room began to fade in around him, filled with bookshelves and stained glass
            windows. He floats in the air, watching</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Where am I?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He sees an old woman sitting on a chair under a long staircase. A young girl with red
            hair runs up to the woman, who smiles down at her</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Grandmother</speaker> Long ago, people lived in peace, bathed in the warmth of
            light. Everyone loved the light. Then people began to fight over it. They wanted to keep
            it for themselves. And darkness was born in their hearts. The darkness spread,
            swallowing the light and many people’s hearts. It covered everything, and the world
            disappeared. But small fragments of light survived...in the hearts of children. With
            these fragments of light, children rebuilt the lost world. It’s the world we live in
            now. But the true light sleeps, deep within the darkness. That’s why the worlds are
            still scattered, divided from each other. But someday, a door to the innermost darkness
            will open. And the true light will return. So, listen, child. Even in the deepest
            darkness, there will always be a light to guide you. Believe in the light, and the
            darkness will never defeat you. Your heart will shine with its power and push the
            darkness away. Do you understand, Kairi?</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He scans the room, seeing no one for a second. Blinking again, he is back floating in
            the air, seeing the 4 year-old Kairi, who looks around. He bends forward, trying to
            reach her, but she disappears and he is thrown back to reality</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (shocked)</speaker> Huh?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> What’s the matter?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Um, nothing. Kairi... Did you call me?</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Cid walks back to them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> I installed that navigation gummi. But, ya know? That place is
            crawling with Heartless. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He gives them a gummi block. They leave for the Olympus Coliseum and compete in the

        <sp>
            <speaker>Hercules</speaker> Show me what you’ve got!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hercules, wait. Let’s go one-on-one!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Oh, brother. What a show-off.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> What’re we gonna do?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Let him go alone, I guess.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Good luck, Sora!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Hercules</speaker> I’m not gonna go easy on you!</sp>

        <desc>Sora fights and defeats Hercules, winning a trophy. Phil dances on the steps of the
            arena as Sora smiles at Donald and Goofy, holding the trophy in his hands. They return
            to the Vestibule</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Hercules</speaker> Wow! And I didn’t even hold back!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Now I finally know what you mean about strength of heart. Mine
            comes from Donald and Goofy.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> Come again?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> If we stick together, we’re unbeatable. Not even Hercules stands

        <sp>
            <speaker>Hercules (picking Phil up)</speaker> Of course. Your friends give you strength.
            Isn’t that right, Phil? The three of you together make great heroes.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He puts Phil back down</desc>
        <sp>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora and Hercules slam their hands together. Sora, Donald, and Goofy push the pedestal
            in the room over to reveal the Keyhole in the floor. Sora stands in front of it and
            holds his Keyblade up. The blade glows and the Keyhole is sealed. Sora talks to
            Hercules</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Hercules</speaker> Phil wasn’t happy that I lost to you. Said I was getting
            soft. You beat me last time, but next time won’t be so easy.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They leave the Olympus Coliseum and travel to the next world. They disembark on a
            tiled platform in the middle of a raging waterfall. Strangely, the waterfalls seem to be
            going upward. Goofy points further ahead, past the waterfalls</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Gawrsh, look at that!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I know this place...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They walk closer and gaze up at Hollow Bastion, a ruined castle, twisted by the
            darkness inhabiting the world for so long</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Hmm, that’s strange.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I wonder why... I feel this warmth inside, right here.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He places his hand on his chest</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Aw, you’re just hungry.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hey, I’m serious!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>A loud roar erupts from further ahead, startling them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Let’s go!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They travel along the crystalline platforms toward the origin of the sound. Above on a
            platform with a stone arch, Riku is confronting a figure in a violet cloak. From the
            hairy claws and tail protruding from the bottom of the cloak, it was undeniably
            animal</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> No vessel, no help from the Heartless... So tell me, how’d you
            get here?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The beast stands on its hind legs as a human, and it gazed upon Riku with the same
            resolution as human eyes would, but the rest of its body, from its horns to its fangs to
            its claws, screamed otherwise. It began to speak, its voice low and rough</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> I simply believed. Nothing more to it. When our world fell into
            darkness, Belle was taken from me. I vowed I would find her again no matter what the
            cost. I believed I would find her. So, here I am. She must be here. I will have her
            back!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku (challenging)</speaker> Take her, if you can!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The beast roars and leaps up at Riku. It swipes at him with its sharp claws, but Riku
            flips backward, dodging the attack completely. The beast’s cloak settles to his side as
            Riku lands on his feet. With lightning speed, Riku charges forward at the beast. Sora
            arrives in time to see the beast fall to the ground with a stinging growl</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Stop!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Riku looks over at the three of them standing in front of the beast. He smirks
            confidently</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> So, you finally made it. About time. I’ve been waiting for you.
            We’ve always been rivals, haven’t we? You’ve always pushed me as I’ve always pushed
            you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Riku...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> But it all ends here. There can’t be two Keyblade masters.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What are you talking about?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Let the Keyblade choose...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He holds a hand to his chest</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> ...its true master.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He extends his hand out toward the Keyblade, which begins to shake violently in Sora’s
            grasp. Sora grabs the blade with two hands as it starts to pull itself toward Riku. The
            Keyblade flashes out of Sora’s hands...</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora &amp; Goofy</speaker> Huh?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> What!?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>...and reappears in Riku’s. He stares up at it, smiling darkly</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Maleficent was right. You don’t have what it takes to save
            Kairi.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He turns his gaze skyward</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> It’s up to me. Only the Keyblade master can open the secret
            door...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He holds the blade high</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> ...and change the world.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> But that’s impossible. How did this happen? I’m the one who
            fought my way here with the Keyblade!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Riku looks at his Keyblade again</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> You were just the delivery boy.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He dispels the blade and pulls out a wooden sword</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Sorry, your part’s over now. Here, go play hero with this.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He tosses the sword to Sora, which lands on the stone platform with a clunk. Sora
            falls to his hands and knees in defeat as Riku leaves. Donald and Goofy watch him
            leave</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Goofy. Let’s go. We have to remember our mission.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Oh! Well, I know the king told us to follow the key and all...
            But...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He gazes back toward Sora giving a sad grumble. Donald stops</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Sora, Sorry.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They continue after Riku. Sora doesn’t move, feeling the cold stone beneath his
            fingers and the spray of the water on his clothes. He is nearly deaf to the low growl
            and thumping footsteps behind him. He looks up, seeing the beast walk past him. He
            watches as it falls to the ground again with a moan. Sora gets up and runs to his
            side</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hey, don’t move. You’re hurt.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He looks over at Sora, who notices his intensely human eyes</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> Why... Why did you...you come here? I came to fight for
            Belle.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He looks up at the castle and stands up again. He starts slowly walking ahead</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> And though I am on my own, I will fight. I won’t leave without
            her. That’s why I’m here.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora turns around, staring at the wooden sword on the ground. He picks it up and walks
            back to the Beast’s side</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Me too. I’m not gonna give up now. I came here to find someone
            very important to me.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They make their way up to the furthest platform and gaze at Hollow Bastion. Mysterious
            gases swirl from pipes protruding from the castle. The center of its towers displays a
            large Heartless emblem, shattered from the inside, the gears clearly visible from the
            platform. Mechanical cranes are built into all sides of the castle, though are largely
            rusted and overgrown, as if the innards of the castle themselves came alive and rooted
            themselves deeply across its façade. The rest of the world below has become a barren
            crystalline wasteland and darkness waits at every corner. A switch activates and a pink
            light appears at the castle. A magical line appears toward them, bringing a metal
            platform with it, rigged to the line with electric sparks. Sora and the Beast walk onto
            the elevator, which takes them up to Hollow Bastion. Finding the castle gates locked,
            they descend into the watery underbelly of the fortress, finding the access switch in
            the confusing maze of the dungeons. They release the switch, and the gears in the wall
            begin to spin and they hear the sound of a door opening. Heading back to the castle
            gates, they enter the main Hall. Meanwhile in the Grand Hall, Jasmine, Alice, and the
            other princesses of heart are encased in crystal chambers on the sides of the room under
            the effects of a sleeping curse. Maleficent walks over an ornate carpet bearing the
            Heartless insignia toward a large open room, each footfall echoing in the vacant hall.
            Kairi’s body rests in a dark capsule in the center of the room. Maleficent’s fingers
            curl around her staff as she passes the capsule and ascends the stairs. She whirls
            around to face the princesses of heart</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> O purest of hearts! Reveal to me the Keyhole!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She raises her arms fervently. The hearts of the six maidens lining the walls glow in
            unison and beams of pink light shine out from them. The six meet at a point in the air
            over Kairi’s body, pointing a trail of sparkles to a great heart in the room beyond.
            Maleficent watches, and smiles. Meanwhile, Sora and Beast arrive in the Entrance Hall,
            seeing no one</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> Be on your guard. They’re close, I can feel it. Are you ready
            for them?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora moves forward as Beast gasps</desc>

            <speaker>Beast</speaker> Belle?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He whirls around, seeing the faint shape of a woman in a golden dress in the dark
            doorway. It erupts into a cloud of darkness, where a Shadow Heartless appears. The Beast
            shakes, rage and frustration flowing within him. He gives out a great roar and charges
            after the Heartless, the door closing in on him, separating him from Sora. The sound
            echoes in Sora’s ears</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Quit while you can.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora turns, seeing Riku with Donald and Goofy</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> No. Not without Kairi.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> The darkness will destroy you.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Tendrils of darkness erupt around Riku and his clothes take on a darker quality. He
            clenches his fists, feeling the dark powers inside his heart, and glares at who he used
            to call a friend</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> You’re wrong, Riku. The darkness may destroy my body, but it
            can’t touch my heart.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He holds a hand over his chest</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> My heart will stay with my friends. It’ll never die!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Really... Well, we’ll just see about that!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He thrusts his hand forward, releasing a dark fireball aimed straight at Sora’s heart.
            The energy courses through his hand, causing the air to ripple, his hair whipping across
            his face. Sora is paralyzed as it draws near him and he closes his eyes, hearing a
            crash</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Sora ain’t gonna go anywhere!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora opens his eyes, seeing Goofy standing in front of him with his shield out. The
            energy, upon contact with the shield, has fizzled into the air around him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> You’d betray your king?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Not on your life! But I’m not gonna betray Sora, either, ‘cause
            he’s become one of my best buddies after all we’ve been through together!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He turns to look at Sora, giving him a thumbs up</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy (waving)</speaker> See ya later, Donald. Could ya tell the king I’m
            really sorry?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Hold on, Goofy! We’ll tell him together.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He runs over to the two of them and looks up at Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Well, you know... All for one and one for all.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> I guess you’re stuck with us, Sora.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (staring at the floor)</speaker> Thanks a lot... Donald, Goofy.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> How will you fight without a weapon?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora looks back up at him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I know now I don’t need the Keyblade. I’ve got a better weapon.
            My heart.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Riku scoffs</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Your heart? What good will that weak little thing do for
            you?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> All though my heart may be weak, it’s not alone. It’s grown with
            each new experience, and it’s found a home with all the friends I’ve made. I’ve become a
            part of their heart just as they’ve become a part of mine. And if they think of me now
            and then...if they don’t forget me...then our hearts will be one.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He takes out the wooden sword</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I don’t need a weapon. My friends are my power!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The Keyblade flashes in Riku’s hand, much to his surprise. It disappears and he stares
            at his hand, gasping in total astonishment. The Keyblade reappears in Sora’s hands, and
            he stares down at Riku, who takes out Soul Eater, his winged sword. Riku rushes forward
            attacking Sora in a flourish of hits. Sora dodges sideways and spins around, sliding
            back toward Riku and striking with his Keyblade. He reels back, landing on his right
            foot. Bending his knee, he pushes off and jumps into the air over Goofy. Riku lands back
            on the floor and strikes through Donald, knocking him out. He sends all his frustration
            into his sword as he slashes at Sora, who holds his Keyblade in two hands, blocking
            Riku’s blows. Seeing a free opportunity, he bashes Riku in the side with the blade,
            sending him flying backward toward the fountain in the center of the room</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> No... Not yet...</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He bends over, breathing heavily. The darkness around his clothes fades and he runs
            away in disgrace. Beast enters the room behind them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> So, your heart won this battle.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora nods and they continue through the castle. In the Castle Chapel, Riku runs over
            the cold stone floor out of breath</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Why? It was mine.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> Know this.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He stops at the sound of the voice, catches his breath and turns around</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> The heart that is strong and true shall win the Keyblade.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He sees a cloaked figure emerging from the darkness covered in an unearthly
            glow</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> What? You’re saying my heart’s weaker than his?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Riku glares at it in defiance</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> For that instant, it was.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Riku’s eyes widen and he shakes his head, staring at the floor</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> However, you can become stronger.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The figure walks closer to him, the X on its chest nearly visible</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> You showed no fear in stepping through the door to darkness. It
            held no terror for you. Plunge deeper into the darkness, and your heart will grow even
            stronger.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> What should I do?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> It’s really quite simple. Open yourself to the darkness. That
            is all. Let your heart, your being become darkness itself.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Riku glows with a green aura. He looks up at the figure, as it moves closer to him.
            Meanwhile, Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Beast ascend the castle. As they approach the Castle
            Chapel, Maleficent stands in the Grand Hall, gazing into the Dark Depths where the
            Keyhole lays in wait. Riku, in his dark clothing, walks to join her. He speaks, his
            voice taking on an eerie quality</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> So, I see the path has emerged at last.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Yes. The Keyhole to the darkness.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The great heart before them brims with energy</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Unlock it and the Heartless will overrun this world.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> What do I care? The darkness holds no power over me.
            Rather, I will use its power to rule all worlds.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Such confidence.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He holds up his hand and a dark Keyblade appears, the blade’s teeth forming the
            negative space of a heart. Maleficent gazes down at it, intrigued</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Oh!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The Keyblade fails to react in the Keyhole presence, much to Maleficent’s
            annoyance</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Impossible! The princesses of heart are all here! It must
            be her.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She turns back, her eyes narrowed in irritation, settling on the body of Kairi,
            sleeping on the floor. They walk over to her</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Without her heart, she will never be able to release her
            power.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They hear a sound and look in the direction of the Castle Chapel</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> The king’s fools are here. I’ll deal with them
            myself.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She begins to walk away</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> You stay here and guard the princesses.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She gracefully exits as Riku watches her leave, a smirk appearing on his face as an
            unearthly glow surrounds him. Maleficent enters the chapel, coming face to face with
            Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Beast</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> I’m afraid you’re too late. Any moment now, the final
            Keyhole will be unsealed. This world will be plunged into darkness. It is
            unstoppable.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Her eyes flicker with her dark thoughts</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (arming himself with the Keyblade)</speaker> We’ll stop it! After coming
            this far, there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She glowers at his impertinence, slamming her staff against the stone floor</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> You poor, simple fools. You think you can defeat me? Me,
            the mistress of all evil?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She raises her arms and the platform underneath her rises out of the ground. It hovers
            in the air out of their reach. She taps her staff against it, and it sails across the
            room. The top of her staff sparks with green fire and she lifts it into the air,
            cackling</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Now you’ll know the meaning of fear! A bolt of lightning
            to strike them down!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Violet lightning crackles on the ceiling, sending thunderbolts down on top of them.
            Donald sends a Gravira spell at the witch’s platform, causing it to crash to the floor.
            Maleficent recovers from the fall and they rush in and attack her</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> No!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She swipes at them with her staff, knocking Sora away</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Meteors of heaven, unleash thy fury!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Behind her, a swirling vortex appears, and large meteors fly in towards them. The wind
            whips through Sora’s hair as they attempt to dodge the unending shower of rocks. Goofy
            covers himself with his shield as Beast is struck down by a meteor. Donald jumps away,
            but is sideswiped by another. As the witch cackles evilly, Sora stands his ground,
            placing a hand over his heart</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Give me strength!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora spins the Keyblade in his hands, holding the blade upwards and turning it
            clockwise. The tip of the blade glows and magic swirls down the shaft. As it reaches the
            hilt, Tinker Bell emerges twirling in the air. She flies to Sora and touches his nose,
            healing him. He smiles as she twirls around him. Tink flies to Beast and heals him as
            Maleficent narrows her eyes</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Come out!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Tinker Bell continues to heal the party as Heartless appear in the room. Maleficent
            raises her platform again, knocking Sora and Goofy off, floating to the other end of the
            room. Sora takes out the Heartless as Donald strikes the platform with another Gravira
            spell. Sora slides toward Maleficent and attacks her</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Away!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>A large bolt of lightning erupts from the ceiling, striking Sora at full force. He
            falls over, but Tinker Bell revives him and disappears. Donald attacks the witch with
            various spells as Goofy protects him. Just as she is about to summon another meteor
            shower, Beast lunges at her, claws bared</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> No!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She bends over, her breath coming short. A portal appears behind her and she walks
            through it. In a hidden room of the castle, Maleficent clutches her chest, using her
            staff for balance. Her breath came in tight as a corridor of darkness appeared behind
            where she tread. Riku steps out of it, the dark Keyblade in hand</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Do you need some help?</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Yes. A Keyblade.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He holds it up</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> But unlike yours, this Keyblade holds the power to unlock
            people’s hearts. Allow me to demonstrate... Behold!</sp>

        <desc>He stabs Maleficent in the chest with the Keyblade</desc>

            darkness itself!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He releases the Keyblade and retreats into a portal. Maleficent stands up straight,
            and quietly laughs to herself</desc>

            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Darkness... The true darkness!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She erupts in green flames, sending them billowing higher into the air, her dark
            shadow etched in its smoky tendrils as her form changes. She grows larger, her black
            cloak expanding outward and filling with green. From her back, large wings push outward
            splitting to her sides, knocking the green from her body into sparks. The black wings
            connect with gray translucent skin to a large black body, heavily muscled and scaled.
            The dragon rears back on its hind legs and slams the ground, eyes and mouth a blazing
            yellow. Donald sends a Blizzara spell at the dragon, who brushes it off like nothing.
            Sora goes after the head as Beast charges forward, his roars echoing off the stone
            walls</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> Step aside!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>His claws dig into the dragon’s flesh. The dragon screeches and spins, knocking them
            all back with her tail. The dragon’s mouth foams with green flame and it spew fire from
            its mouth, setting the room ablaze. Goofy throws his shield at her, but it only enrages
            the monster further. Donald continues shooting Blizzara spells to try to dampen the
            fire, while Sora searches for a way over the flames. He whirls around, his eyes settling
            on the thick vines lining the walls and starts climbing. The dragons screeches, Beast
            having made it angry enough. It rears back on its hind legs, conjuring fire at the base
            of its neck. The fireballs fly through the air towards Sora. Finding the highest point
            of the vines, Sora sees the fireballs coming at him. He sends a Blizzara spell, but it
            only takes out half of them. Donald sees this and conjures an Aero spell around Sora,
            protecting him from the rest of the fire. As Beast distracts the dragon, Sora kicks off
            the wall spiraling towards the creature. He spins and his Keyblade collides with the
            dragon, who thrashes in pain before crashing to the floor, sending ashes into the air.
            The thorny vines surrounding the room burst into green flame and disappear as Maleficent
            leaves nothing but her torn cloak behind. Riku walks over it</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> How ironic. She was just another puppet after all.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> What?</sp>

            <speaker>Riku</speaker> The Heartless were using Maleficent from the beginning. She
            failed to notice the darkness in her heart eating away at her. A fitting end for such a
            fool.</sp>

        <desc>He grounds his foot into the floor and the cloak disappears. He backs away into a
            corridor of darkness. Sora finds a summon gem and they return to the Castle Chapel,
            where a hidden entrance appears. They follow it to the Grand Hall, where they see the
            princesses encapsulated. They run up the stairs to the main area in front of the great
            heart, where Kairi sleeps. A barrier prevents Beast and Goofy’s entry, to Donald’s
            surprise</desc>

        <sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Yes, and without her power, the Keyhole will remain incomplete.
            It is time she awakened.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Whoever you are, let Riku go! Give him back his heart!</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> The princess’s heart is responding. It has been there all along.
            Kairi’s heart rests within you!</sp>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Tell me. Who are you?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku (smiling)</speaker> It is I, Ansem, the seeker of darkness.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He walks toward Sora, prompting Donald to yell out and rush at him, but simply knocks
            the duck past the barrier and moves on. He stands over Sora, looking down with euphoria,
            and points his Keyblade toward him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Ansem</speaker> So, I shall release you now, Princess. Complete the Keyhole

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora strikes, hitting him square in the side. He winces, but recovers, blocking a
            further attack. He tries to toy with Sora, forcing him to strike first and dodging at
            the last minute. Sora blocks his next strike and sends a Thunder spell at Ansem, who
            responds with a dark fireball that hits Sora straight in the chest</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>An aura surrounds him and he floats into the air, his left hand glowing. He plunges
            his Keyblade into the ground, unleashing lightning shockwaves from the floor. Ansem’s
            eyes are wide with madness and he laughs as he fights Sora. He swipes the Keyblade down,
            sending a blade of energy surging toward Sora, who deploys an Aero spell</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Ansem starts running impossibly fast, pelting Sora with blow after blow from his
            Keyblade as he rushes around the room. Sora endures the blows, waiting for the chance to
            strike. He heals as soon as he can and once Ansem stops running, tosses the Keyblade at
            him, hitting him square in the face. Riku’s body disappears, leaving behind the dark
            Keyblade</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He smiles at them and holds the blade in both hands, stabbing himself in the chest.
            His chest glows brightly and the Keyblade floats out of him. He closes his eyes and
            starts to fall backwards. The dark Keyblade splits into six hearts, that float back into
            the princesses. Another heart surges from Sora’s chest and floats back to Kairi, who
            opens her eyes. The entrance to the Dark Depths shimmers, the barrier broken, and Sora
            glows brightly, slowly falling. Donald runs toward him</desc>

    <cutscene>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> So the darkness is flowing out of that Keyhole...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> No wonder there are more and more Heartless everywhere. The
            only way to stop them is—</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (holding up his Keyblade)</speaker> Seal the Keyhole, right?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Maybe. But no one knows what will happen once it’s sealed.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (concerned)</speaker> Well, we can’t just stay here. We have to do
            something. I’ve got a friend back there.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> That’s right. You have one more friend to worry about. Riku’s
            Keyblade must have been born of the captive princesses’ hearts—just like that Keyhole
            you saw.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He looks up at Kairi</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Of course, without Kairi’s heart, it remained incomplete. Once
            that Keyblade was destroyed, the princesses’ hearts should have been freed. Don’t worry,
            Sora. If anyone can save your friend, you can.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Not sure why, but the Heartless are getting stronger. New
            types of Heartless are popping up all over the place! If anything happens to us, I know
            we can count on you, Sora.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Even in your Heartless form, I knew it was you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> I thought the Keyhole would strength the darkness. I mean the
            darkness is strong, but still... It’s almost as if someone is holding the darkness
            back.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> It seems the other princesses have been freed as well. Jasmine
            apparently hasn’t returned to Agrabah. I suspect the others are still in the castle,
            too.</sp>

            coliseum?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Yup.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> I wonder if he’s still searching for his friend? Sora. If you
            see him, please tell him to be careful. He’s not that friendly, but we all care about
            him dearly.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> I don’t think I can let you do that, kid. The Heartless there are
            multiplying by the minute. They’d eat your ship up.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Then what can we do?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Simple. Go around ‘em instead of through. Install a new
            navigation gummi and take a new route.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> A new gummi? From where?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> The secret waterway. When I came here 9 years ago, I stored it

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Oh, your grandma’s story, right?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> That’s right. We were together.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> You know what’s funny? I looked everywhere for you, but you were
            with me all along. Finally, we’re together, Kairi.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>An image of Sora floats in darkness</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I was lost in the darkness. I couldn’t find my way. As I
            stumbled through the dark, I started forgetting things—my friends, who I was. The
            darkness almost swallowed me. But then I heard a voice—your voice. You brought me
            back.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> I didn’t want to just forget about you, Sora. I couldn’t.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> That’s it! Our hearts are connected.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He puts a hand to his chest</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> And the light from our hearts broke through the darkness. I saw
            that light. I think that’s what saved me. No matter how deep the darkness, a light
            shines within. I guess it’s more than just a fairy tale.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Well, let’s go.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> You can’t go.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Why not?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Because it’s way too dangerous.</sp>

            can’t go alone.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Kairi, even if we’re apart, we’re not alone anymore. Right?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> I can’t help?</sp>
        <sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> I’ve been trying to get through to you, but the darkness in
            your heart kept me away.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Who are you? What’s happened to me?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> Your heart won the battle against the darkness, but it was too
            late for your body. That’s why you’re here—in this place of darkness where hearts are
            gathered.</sp>
        <sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> The Door of Darkness will open soon, but it’s a door we can’t
            enter. It has to be closed from both sides. To do this, you need two keys and two
            hearts. Maybe you’re here for the same reason I am. Maybe it was fate.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Fate, huh? You seem to know everything, don’t you? Then tell me:
            Are Sora and Kairi okay?</sp>

            clearing crowded with tree stumps, where Tigger and a young kangaroo are practicing
            their bouncing. Owl flies in overhead as Sora sees a giant honey pot in the center of
            the clearing. He walks over to the seesaw where Tigger and Roo are bouncing</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> This here is my bouncin’ spot! We can bounce around here all

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Okay!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> To bounce with the finest, you’ll need some pointers from the

        <desc>Roo jumps over to the seesaw, followed by Tigger. Roo bounces on his side of the
            seesaw, sending Tigger up into the tree above them. Tigger bounces from the tree onto
            the tree stumps and back across to the cliff. Sora repeats the pattern and Tigger
            bounces with glee</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> You’ve gotten mighty good at bouncin’, Sora! Right, Roo?</sp>

            <speaker>Hades</speaker> Yo, hey, how’re you doin’ everybody, yeah. Got a minute? Hades,

        <desc>He turns red, stretching his arms out and sending large torrents of flame out from

            dodge rolls through the flame. Goofy holds his shield in front of him as Hades slams his
            arms down sending fire onto him. Sora sends another Blizzaga spell at Hades and he reels
            back</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>He throws another fireball at Goofy, but Sora dashes in front of him, blocking it with
            his Keyblade, which sends the fireball straight back at Hades. The god of the Underworld
            falls unconscious and Sora delivers a string of blows with his Keyblade. He heals Donald
            and the three of them attack at once as Hades regains consciousness. Hades is sent
            flying back into the hypogeum. He stands up and shakes in fear</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Hades</speaker> Oh! Hey, kid, wh-what are you doing?</sp>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>The gates of the hypogeum clamp shut as roars are heard from beyond. Later, the final
            match of the Hades Cup begins as a large stone creature, the Rock Titan, smashes into
            the arena. Its two heads look down on them with one objective. It moves toward Sora,
            Donald, and Goofy, towering over them, sending shockwaves through the arena floor. Sora
            sends his Keyblade through the air, attacking the titan’s feet. Eventually, it falls on
            its back, its heads vulnerable to attack. Sora climbs on top of the titan and strikes
            them with Graviga spells. They try to swing at him and he dodges backward. The Rock
            Titan stands back up, lifting its arms. It slams them down into the ground, creating an
            enormous shockwave through the earth. Sora stumbles under the titan as it lifts its
            strong rocky leg</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Sora!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Donald sends a Cura spell, healing Sora, and Goofy charges forward at full speed,
            knocking Sora out of the way of the titan’s foot as it came crashing down. Goofy falls
            unconscious as the Rock Titan roars into the air. Sora glares at the creature and feels
            energy welling up inside him. He strikes its leg, knocking it over once again as Donald
            pulls Goofy to safety. Sora jumps on top of it and sends out a flurry of attacks until
            the Rock Titan crumbles. Sora covers his eyes as dust blows everywhere as Goofy is
            healed. Sora looks around, hearing a rumbling sound as the air grows cold. A large icy
            hand smashes onto the wall of the arena, shortly followed by another, before the
            towering Ice Titan rears its ugly head over the wall. Sora backs away slowly and the
            titan slams its foot down onto the floor of the arena, spreading its icy power along the
            floor. It roars at them, staring at them through emotionless eyes, blowing icy wind
            through the air. It begins shooting ice shards at the group, causing Donald to send back
            Fira spells. Goofy deflects the ice with his shield, forcing the titan to fall to its
            knees. Sora moves in and delivers a string of blows to the titan’s head. It roars again
            and sends a flurry of ice shards at everyone. Donald casts Aerora on the group and Sora
            sends Fira spells at the monster. It hisses as the ice shards expand larger when hitting
            the shields of wind surrounding them. An icy mist surrounds Sora and before he could
            move, he was frozen on the spot. The Ice Titan stomps on the ground, moving closer to
            him, sending shockwaves through its feet</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Sora!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He sends a Fira spell at Sora, breaking him out of the ice in time to slam his
            Keyblade into the foot of the Ice Titan. It clamps its hands onto its head, slowly
            shrinking, surrounded by a dense cold air. It punches its foot into the ground, but its
            leg breaks and the ice in the ground dissipates. It stares confused, hearing a set of
            rumbling sounds. It looks up, seeing Sora towering over him, and reels back in fear.
            Sora moves to step on it, but it falls over just in time to miss his giant foot. The
            creature runs away, trailing dust, and jumps through the gate at the end of the arena.
            The three celebrate as Hades grumbles behind the gate of the hypogeum. Donald jumps up,
            sending a Blizzaga spell at Hades’s hair, blowing out the flame much to the god’s
            surprise. Sora holds the Hades Cup trophy and looks over to a smiling Hercules as Phil
            laughs proudly. Later, they travel back to Hollow Bastion by a new route and disembark
            at the Rising Falls, where Beast waits for them</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Let’s go ask them.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> You may need my strength. I’ll go with you.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They make their way up to the castle. They enter the library and Beast walks slowly up
            the stairs. Belle turns away from a bookcase to face him and his eyes light up</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> Belle!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They walk over to each other and embrace. Sora, Donald, and Goofy join them</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Belle</speaker> You’ve come to seal the Keyhole, right? Please, be careful. The
            darkness is raging deep inside. We’ve been holding it back, but we can’t hold out much
            longer.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> We’ll take care of it.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Belle</speaker> This is for you. Use it to face the darkness, as the Beast
            has.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She hands him a rose-shaped Keychain</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Belle</speaker> So many books, but not one on how to banish the darkness. Maybe
            it’s hopeless... </sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They continue on to the Castle Chapel, where the rest of the princesses of heart are
            gathered. They talk to Aurora and Cinderella</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> We’ve been waiting for you, Keyblade master.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Where’s Ansem?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> Gone.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> When the Keyhole appeared, darkness poured out of it. It
            swallowed Ansem, and he disappeared.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> Though Ansem is gone, the flood of darkness hasn’t
            stopped. We’re working together to hold it back.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> I cannot forget the look on his face. As the darkness engulfed
            him, he was smiling.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They talk to Jasmine, Alice, and Snow White</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> Sora, please hurry! Darkness is pouring from the
            Keyhole.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Alice</speaker> It’s all we can do just to hold back the darkness.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Snow White</speaker> I don’t even know how long we can manage even that.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> All right, I’m on my way.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Snow White</speaker> We’re counting on you, Keyblade master. In the meantime,
            we’ll do what we can, too.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> Ansem has ignored us since the Keyhole appeared.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> I don’t think Ansem will ever return.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Alice</speaker> We must close the Keyhole before it’s too late.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> Can you feel the immense power flowing from that
            Keyhole?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Snow White</speaker> Please hurry. Our strength is running out.</sp>

        <desc>Sora, Donald, Goofy and Beast battle Heartless through the Grand Hall and enter the
            Dark Depths to find the Keyhole. They run in and find themselves face-to-face with an
            enormous Behemoth Heartless. They subdue the giant horned enemy by destroying its horn.
            It disappears and they see a large Heartless insignia in the abyss with a Keyhole
            embedded in it</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Now let’s go and seal that big Keyhole!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Sora. You did it.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They turn around and leave the Dark Depths to find the source of the voice. In the
            Grand Hall, they see Leon, Yuffie, and Aerith</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What are you guys doing here?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> We came in Cid’s ship.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> This is our childhood home. We wanted to see it again.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> It’s in worse shape than I feared. It used to be so
            peaceful...</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Don’t worry. If we defeat Ansem, all should be restored.
            Including your island.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Really?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> But, it also means goodbye.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Once the worlds are restored, they’ll all be separate
            again.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Everyone will go back to where they came from.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Then I’ll visit you guys with the gummi ship.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon (crossing his arms)</speaker> It’s not that simple.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Before all this, you didn’t know about the other worlds,
            right?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Because every world was isolated. Impassable walls divided
            them.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> The Heartless destroyed those walls. But if the worlds return,
            so will the walls.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Which means gummi ships will be useless.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> So you’re saying we’ll never...?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Their faces become sad</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> We may never meet again, but we’ll never forget each other.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> No matter where we are, our hearts will bring us together
            again.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Besides, I couldn’t forget you even if I wanted to.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What’s that supposed to mean?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Sora!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora looks to Donald and Goofy near the Dark Depths, where darkness is pouring
            out</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Hurry! Come and close the Keyhole!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Sora, good luck.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora nods to him and runs back to Donald and Goofy. They approach the final glowing
            Keyhole and Sora locks it. The Heartless symbol disappears. They meet back up with the
            princesses in the chapel</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Alice</speaker> Thank you, Sora. I think the darkness has begun to weaken.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> But I can feel a powerful darkness growing somewhere far
            away.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> It’s the heart of the darkness. It must be where Ansem
            went.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Then we’ll take the gummi ship and deal with both Ansem and the
            Heartless.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> A worthy answer, Keyblade master. We offer this power to
            aid your battle.</sp>

        <desc>Cinderella upgrades Sora’s Fira spell</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Snow White</speaker> Sora, your courage can bring back our worlds.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> Once the darkness is gone, all should return to its original
            state.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Kairi will be back on the island?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> Most certainly. And you should be, too.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I can’t go home ‘til I find Riku and the king.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> I still can’t believe we played a part in opening the
            Keyhole. To think we had such a power... Simply unimaginable! My world is gone, so I
            suppose I must stay here for the time being.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Alice</speaker> The darkness still lingers, so we’ll stay as well. Otherwise,
            this world will be destroyed, too. We’ll do all we can. You helped me during that silly
            trial. Now it’s my turn to help you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> Maleficent used to live in our world. She used her great
            powers to control the darkness... But eventually it came to control her. I’m so glad the
            others are here with me.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Snow Whtie</speaker> The darkness took my home. I don’t know where to go now. I
            hope my loved ones are safe somewhere. I’ll do whatever I can to keep this world from
            being taken, too. I just want everything back as it was before.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> Please don’t tell Aladdin about all this. He will worry to
            death if you do! I will tell him about it, once I return to Agrabah. I hope everything
            is all right in Agrabah.</sp>
    </cutscene>

        <desc>Sora and company return to the Library and speak to Aerith</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Sora, you should read this.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Read what?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> It’s the rest of Ansem’s report. Maleficent must have
            collected it.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She hands him the report</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Ansem disappeared when this world fell to the darkness. It was
            believed he died defending people from the Heartless. But Ansem was the one who brought
            them here. Ansem waits in darkness. But here’s a little light to protect you, Sora.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>She upgrades his healing spell</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Read that report and you’ll understand Ansem’s intentions. I
            believe the worlds can be restored. They are still alive.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They speak to Leon and Yuffie</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Ansem and Maleficent were both possessed by darkness. You
            know, I just don’t get it. What’s so great about the darkness?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> This was once Ansem’s castle. He was widely respected as a wise
            man. But darkness took him. He began experimenting with people’s hearts. Heh, some wise
            man. So much suffering and ruin, and for what?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> This is my home, but it just doesn’t feel like it. I don’t
            remember much, ‘cause I was only a kid.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> We thought this was Maleficent’s doing. But she was just another
            puppet of the darkness. Just like Ansem. This darkness is our real enemy. But how to
            beat it? Well, first things first. Let’s purge every last Heartless we can find.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> There are no Heartless here, so rest up. We’ve gotta get rid
            of the Heartless and rebuild this world.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> I won’t use my real name until this world is restored.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They speak to Belle</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Belle</speaker> Ansem desires the darkness. He thinks it’s the source of all
            power. What nonsense. Darkness may shroud light, but it can never extinguish it. Sora,
            don’t succumb to the darkness. You and the Keyblade can defeat it.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to the Olympus Coliseum, where a special enemy has
            appeared. Sora runs into the arena, looking around. A large portal appears in the sky,
            sending a beam down to the ground. Through the brightness, Sora could see a man with
            long silver hair. The man stands up slowly, a wing protruding from right side of his
            back. He stretches out his arm and the wing follows suit. Sora stares as Sephiroth faces
            him, smiling through sinister eyes. He slowly places a hand on the elongated nodachi
            sheathed at his hip. He stands far from Sora, but as he unsheathes the sword, he strikes
            Sora from afar. Sora rushes him and attacks, before dodging away as the man’s range
            overtakes him. Sephiroth conjures pillars of flame around him, but Sora jumps away
            nearly scorched. Dozens of dark orbs surround the man, making it harder for Sora to
            strike at him. He sends a Firaga spell, taking out some of them, before sending down
            lightning bolts with Thundaga. Sephiroth leaps into the air and slashes at Sora in quick
            succession. He lands on the ground and glows with a white aura as several meteors crash
            down from the sky around him. Sora concentrates and flies into the air as the meteors
            orbit around the man. Sora stays in the air out of the way of the rocks. A black hole
            spins above Sephiroth’s head, absorbing the meteors and the man begins teleporting
            around striking Sora and retreating. While a good distance away from Sora, Sephiroth
            floats into the air chanting, but before he finishes, Sora tosses his Keyblade at him,
            knocking him to the ground. He stumbles back, clutching his stomach. He stares at Sora
            and floats into the air. He stretches out his arms as a light erupts from him. The air
            around him ripples and the mysterious man disappears. Later, Cloud walks into the
            Coliseum arena with his buster sword out, a serious look on his face. He stops, seeing a
            blue feather fall from the sky. As the feather lands, Cloud looks up, his eyes making
            contact with Sephiroth. They stare each other down, neither making a move</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cloud</speaker> I’ve been looking for you.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sephiroth</speaker> As have I.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cloud</speaker> As long as you exist, I’ll never wake from this nightmare.
            You’re my darkness.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sephiroth (extending his arms)</speaker> I’m a part of you, am I? Then join me
            in this eternal nightmare untarnished by light.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Cloud brandishes his sword and Sephiroth closes his eyes, slowly grasping his blade.
            The tension in the air rises as electricity crackles around the two opponents, sending
            dirt into the air. Suddenly, they charge and their swords clash violently, their single
            wings extending and sending them airborne. They trade blows over and over, neither side
            gaining the upper hand. They split apart and Cloud charges, this time pushing Sephiroth
            back. Before his blade hits him, Sephiroth teleports away, leaving only feathers. Cloud
            looks up, glaring at Sephiroth who extends a hand to him. He smiles, only angering Cloud
            further, and the two soldiers clash swords, sending out a white hot light through the
            sky. At this time, a portal appears in the Castle Chapel at Hollow Bastion, alerting the
            princesses to its presence</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> Could the appearance of that gate be a bad omen?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Snow White</speaker> There’s an ominous presence beyond the gate.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Alice</speaker> What is this feeling? It’s different from darkness... Be
            careful, Sora!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> I sense a presence coming from that gate... But it’s not
            darkness. It’s another power altogether. It may be even more dangerous than
            darkness.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> We could suppress the power if it were darkness. But this is
            different. It’s a force unlike darkness... A force different from both the light and the
            darkness.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Beast enter the portal, finding themselves in the room where
            Maleficent was defeated. An invisible figure shimmers in the air behind them, walking
            closer towards Sora, who turns and gasps as a man in a black cloak walks right through
            him. The world freezes and memories flash through Sora’s mind in rapid succession <q>No
                problem. Let’s do it! Hold on! What’s that over there? She arrived on the night of
                the meteor shower! A huge black thing swallowed me up. So, you’re from another
                world? A paopu fruit... What? There’s no way you’re getting this! I’m so glad that
                you’re okay, Kairi. The Keyblade... The Heartless? I wonder if I could find Riku and
                Kairi... Anyway, she’s not the one you’re looking for. That’s the power of the
                Keyblade! Now I finally know what you mean about strength of heart. Right, my
                friends! Sorry about what I said. Guess you don’t get out much, huh? I promise.
                You’re stupid. Sooner or later they’ll swallow your heart. I’ve finally found her. I
                still can’t believe it. I know this place... No. Not without Kairi. I know now I
                don’t need a Keyblade. I don’t need a weapon. My friends are my power! Give him back
                his heart! There’s no way you’re taking Kairi’s heart! A Keyblade that unlocks
                people’s hearts... I wonder. What’s... What’s happening to me?
                Falling...falling...into darkness. Kairi, thank you. Now, it’s time to get Riku
                back. Even if we’re apart, we’re not alone anymore. Don’t worry. I will.
                Promise.</q>

            <speaker>??????</speaker> You remind me of him.</sp>

        <desc>He gasps as the enigmatic man moves to aim the orb at him, and Sora summons his
            Keyblade. He holds it up just as the energy reaches the blade. It sizzles in the air,
            dissipated by the blade, sparks flying everywhere. Sora pushes it away, sending the orb
            soaring into the rafters of the tower, raining down mortar and stone. The man stares at
            Sora, fascinated by him</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>??????</speaker> It means you are not whole.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>The hooded figure conjures orbs of energy in both hands and flies at them in a flurry
            of darkness, the orbs exploding into giant damaging force fields, knocking Sora and his
            friends back. Sora slides back at the man and strikes, while Donald sends magic from a
            safe distance. The figure then teleports around the room, his speed increasing,
            surrounded by a dark cloud. The man summons red ethereal blades from his hands and spins
            closer to Sora, trying to strike him wild and violently. After a few more strikes, the
            man conjures a ring of blue lasers in the air, firing them towards Sora. He shrouds the
            room in darkness, sending out lasers from all around his body, nearly finishing off
            Goofy and the Beast. After forcefully dodging a numerous amount of attacks and
            countering with his own, the man’s chest glows with energy. He slashes out his hand and
            dispels it</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>??????</speaker> Impressive.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora’s eyes widen, surprised that the man is still standing</desc>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What are you talking about?</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora rushes the man and plants a foot on the ground, pushing off and into the air.
            Raising his Keyblade, the man walks forward through him and the world freezes for a
            second. Sora lands on the other side of the man, who simply stands there. Sora whirls
            around, scowling</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>??????</speaker> It is beyond your comprehension, for now.</sp>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora walks closer, and the man vanishes, the air rippling in his wake</desc>

    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to Traverse Town to return the last group of Dalmatian
            puppies they found along their travels. They enter the Dalmatian’s House. A puppy runs
            up to Pongo and Perdita, looking much jollier than when Sora saw them last. It barks
            happily up at them. Sora enters the Living Room, seeing numerous puppies scattered
            around stretching, yawning, and playing. Pongo walks up to him and gives him a present.
            Perdita joins him and a puppy barks at their feet. In the Piano Room, dozens of puppies
            play on the piano, as more lay happily on the couch in the Den. Several run along the
            floor as Sora enters, and a bunch of them gather around him as he scratches his head.
            Pongo looks over at Perdita and then happily back at their 99 puppies safe and sound.
            Afterwards, they leave for Merlin’s Study. Sora enters the 100 Acre Wood, arriving a a
            winding, muddy path. He finds Pooh, wandering in circles around a bramble bush, his
            footprints trailing him in the mud</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What are you doing, Pooh?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh (pressing a finger to his lips)</speaker> Shh. Quiet, or they’ll get
            away!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Who?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> The people who took everyone away. See their footprints? We were
            all sticking together to make sure no one got lost again. But then, I saw some
            footprints that needed following. So I did. Suddenly, everyone was gone. Bad people must
            have taken them away!</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Actually, Pooh, I think those footprints are... Um... Anyway,
            I’ll help you look for your friends.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>He taps a fist against his chest proudly. Sora walks into the bramble bush, finding
            Eeyore</desc>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Eeyore?</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What are you doing?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Eeyore</speaker> Lookin’ for sticks to build my house...again.</sp>

        <desc>He looks around</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> This place already feels like a house... Seems like a great spot

        <desc>Sora leads Pooh around the muddy path, looking for his friends. Sora jumps on top of a
            well with a blustery wind surging from it. It lifts him into the air and tosses him to
            the top of the cliff. At the top, he sees Tigger bouncing along a log</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> I saw Pooh walkin’ away, so I bounced after him! Then I
            bounced a bit too high, and I lost sight of ol’ Pooh Bear!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora brings Tigger back to the bramble bush. Sora sees Roo on top of a tree root, and
            he hops down to Sora</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Roo</speaker> I tried bouncin’ as high as Tigger. I was so busy tryin’ to

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora leads Roo back to the bush to join the others. Sora climbs the cliff again and
            finds Piglet hiding under a tree</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hello, Piglet. So this is where you’ve been. Maybe I should
            bring Pooh along.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Owl lands nearby and Sora catches him before he takes off again</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> I thought I’d better have a word with Roo about his bouncing. The
            next thing I knew, quite to my surprise, I was lost, too!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora returns Owl to the bush and leads Pooh to a patch of flowers. Pooh grabs them and
            they lure a group of butterflies, which carry him up to the top of the cliff. Sora sees
            Rabbit running in and out of holes in a cliff nearby</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Rabbit</speaker> Owl looked so intent on something, well, I just had to follow
            him! But then Owl flew off into the sky, and there I was, all by myself.</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They take Rabbit to the bramble bush. Sora leads Pooh over the log to the cliff on the
            other side, knocking down a bee’s nest in the way, and up to the tree where Piglet is
            hiding. Pooh walks under the tree and talks to Piglet</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Hello, Piglet.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Piglet</speaker> Pooh! Where are we?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> I don’t know where we are either, Piglet. But if we go back the
            way we came, we should find home.</sp>

        <desc>Piglet appears in a hole at the bottom of the cliff</desc>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Piglet</speaker> You weren’t lonely at all?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Tigger</speaker> Lonely? Are you kiddin’? I’m a Tigger! The most wonderful
            thing about Tiggers is I’m the only one. But I do admit, friends are awfully fun,
            too!</sp>

        <desc>Sora jumps off the hill and walks down the path. Pooh and his friends move to the edge

        <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> You’ve been a great help, Sora. Thank you! You helped Pooh get
            honey from the bees. You helped protect Rabbit’s carrots. You helped find Eeyore’s lost
            tail. You bounced along with Tigger and Roo. And you found all of us when we were lost.
            We can’t thank you enough. This is from all of us in the Hundred Acre Wood.</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> But, if we do beat him and all these worlds become restored and

        <desc>They proceed forward over the bizarre terrain. As they approach the swirling mist, a
            large dark orb falls from the sky, unclouding their vision. They are attacked by a
            Behemoth Heartless and find themselves in a wasteland of snow and crystal. Upon
            defeating the Behemoth, they drop into a Giant Crevasse filled with green web-like
            structures and crystals scattered throughout</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> I wonder where that Ansem feller went?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Dive into the most dangerous place and we’ll find him!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>At the bottom of the crevasse, they find a portal to a sharply formed cave with a
            flaming pillar burning in the center. They jump into the enchanted flame and find
            themselves in a long tiled hallway with a large Heartless insignia at the end of it.
            They defeat the Heartless that appear around them and a door opens in the wall, leading
            to a room with a mysterious device. On the panel of the device a message is written
                <q>Ones born of the heart and darkness, devoid of hearts, ravage all worlds and
                bring desolation. Seize all hearts and consummate the great heart. All hearts to be
                one, one heart to encompass all. Realize the destiny: the realm of Kingdom Hearts.
                The great darkness sealed within the great heart. Progeny of darkness, come back to
                the eternal darkness. For the heart of light shall unseal the path. Seven hearts,
                one Keyhole, one key to the door. The door of darkness, tied by two keys. The door
                of darkness to seal the light. None shall pass but shadows, returning to the
                darkness. Ones born of the heart and darkness, hunger for every heart until the dark
                door opens.</q>
        </desc>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>They return to the hallway and jump into the dark portal in the wall. Returning to the
            stark cave, the pillar of flame has become a swirling hole in the floor. They enter the
            hole and arrive in the Evil Grounds, where they float through the dark air. Beneath them
            is a curved figure with two giant wings. As they hover closer to it, its glowing eyes
            open and it spreads its wings out, stretching up to its full height. The demon Chernabog
            crosses its arms and showers them with its evil gaze. It stands in the caldera of a
            volcano, fire coursing through its veins. They fly towards the beast’s head and begin
            attacking It. It swipes a mighty claw at them, tossing them away before hunching over.
            They glide back to the demon and it raises its arms, roaring loudly as an enormous
            torrent of flames washes over them from the volcano, swirling voraciously around
            Chernabog. Donald sends a Blizzaga spell at the beast and it begins to spew fire from
            its mouth. They fly behind it and attack its neck, dodging another wall of fire. It
            knocks them away again and holds out its arms, spinning them in the air. Spirits appear,
            dancing near the end of its fingers, and it sends them after the trio. Donald casts
            Aeroga on everyone as they fly back into the fray, dodging the attacking spirits. After
            tussling with the dark demon, it roars and bursts into a pillar of white hot flames,
            flapping its huge wings for a final time before sinking into the volcano and vanishing.
            Sora, Donald, and Goofy float down through the crater where they find a white portal.
            They enter it and find themselves in a long tunnel filled with ruins. Dark vines line
            the walls, a grove of round trees in one corner and stone debris in another. They enter
            a second white portal and reach another corridor. Shadows of wicked trees cover the
            walls, their evil faces seemingly watching them as they traverse the somewhat darker
            tunnel. An image of a small door is etched in the wall. They enter another portal to
            another tunnel, the most hollow of all. The image of a castle is displayed on the wall,
            the entire cavern giving them an bleak feeling. They reach a large room with a Heartless
            symbol placed in the wall. A Behemoth appears, but they defeat it and walk over to the
            symbol. A piece breaks off and disappears. They defeat an almost endless horde of
            Heartless, with the pieces of the emblem deteriorating as they battle. Soon, the emblem
            shines and reveals a hidden room. They step into the sandy chamber, dust falling through
            holes in the walls. They see a large ornate door and something stirs in Sora’s
            memory</desc>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Huh?</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> What’s wrong?</sp>

        <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Careful. This is the last haven you’ll find here. Beyond, there
            is no light to protect you. But don’t be afraid. Your heart is the mightiest weapon of
            all. Remember, you are the one who will open the door to the light.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> I don’t hear anything.</sp>
        <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Strange... That voice was so familiar. Maybe it’s just my

        <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Maybe you’d better take a rest!</sp>
    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora steps forward and the doors open. From beyond, light streams in and engulfs the

        <desc>The island flashes and the sky rips open, shattering the peaceful illusion. Beyond the
            gashing tears is a dark, mad world. The beach crumbles and lifts out of the water,
            revealing its rocky undergrowth as what once was a dock splits in two. Ansem stands at
            the edge of the water, still in possession of Riku’s body. They run down to the beach
            where he stands motionless, staring out at the sea</desc>

        <desc>Behind him, darkness bursts from his body, forming into a large black Heartless with
            long antennae. It's teeth are bared, seemingly covered in thick constraints, while its
            torso forms an empty heart. Ansem laughs and the Heartless throws scythes of energy at
            them. Sora dodges them, rolling to the side as Ansem floats above them. Sora moves in,
            striking the man</desc>

        <desc>The Heartless swoops in front of him, taking the blows from Sora’s Keyblade. Donald
            casts Thundaga and Graviga at Ansem, but the man just laughs at him. Ansem floats down
            to them and the Guardian swipes at them with a large hand. The fight continues until
            Ansem flies toward the large tree on the island, which starts to rumble. The branches
            shake violently as the tree is rent asunder, splitting into a corrupt area of vine and
            sinew. Ansem waits inside with the Guardian. Sora, Donald, and Goofy run up to the area,
            but Donald and Goofy are blocked by a barrier. The island shakes and the great black
            shape of Darkside rises from the floor, its wings stretching out behind it. Sora fights
            and defeats the giant Heartless, prompting Ansem to emerge from the shadows</desc>

            who rolls away from them. Ansem glows with a bright aura and the room grows dark) </desc>

            Sora looks down as the Guardian flies up at him, knocking him over. Sora dodges to his
            feet and jumps in the air. He flies forward as the Guardian continues its assault. As
            soon as it returns to Ansem’s side, Sora whirls around and runs straight at the man,
            striking him with the Keyblade. Ansem tries to hide behind his Guardian, but Sora
            predicts this, and with a spinning motion, slams the Keyblade into Ansem’s back. Ansem
            says nothing, and the world goes black</desc>

            fall towards it, a portal appearing above the cage- like middle of the battleship.
            Donald and Goofy scream as they plunge inside it, while Sora falls into the black abyss.
            Riku’s words appear in his head</desc>

            Ansem. He believes... And suddenly, he shoots back out of the darkness, flying up
            towards Ansem, and takes out the Keyblade, an unwavering look upon his face. Ansem
            stares at him with red-orange eyes, haunting, pupil-less in form, as he holds a
            double-edged pole sword in his hand. Sora flies forward, striking Ansem with the

        <desc>Ansem swings his hand, summoning Bit Sniper Heartless, which fly after Sora, their
            bat-like wings flapping in the air. They try to sideswipe him, but are met with the
            Keyblade and disappear. Dodging more lasers, he heals and casts a barrier of air around
            him, flying back to Ansem to finish this once and for all. To Sora’s surprise, he
            dispels his sword and crosses his arms over his body. A large Heartless insignia appears
            over him, blocking him from all attack. The portal over the cage reappears and Sora
            flies into it, finding himself in pitch black room. He is confronted by a horde of
            Shadow Heartless, the only light coming from the Heartless emblem on the floor and their
            eerie glowing eyes. As he destroys the Shadows, a long thread appears in the middle of
            the room, glowing with dark energy. Sora strikes at the Room Core, which explodes,
            sending Sora back to the World of Chaos. The Guardian stares down at him, though Ansem
            doesn’t make a move. On the front of the living battleship, the fleshy artillery begins
            to shoot homing beams of energy at him and another portal appears above them in front of
            the Guardian. The artillery wiggle at the expellant force as Sora flies nearer to the
            portal. He is nearly overwhelmed by the artillery and as he closes in on the portal, the
            Guardian slams his great claws forward, creating a roaring gust of wind, sending Sora
            toppling away. He is again assaulted by laser-emitting orbs, but he quickly dodges in
            midair and flies back to the artillery. After destroying the armaments, he soars into
            the portal of darkness, finding himself in another dark room filled with Darkball
            Heartless</desc>

            following Room Core. They fly back into the World of Chaos, where the hugely-fanged Face
            at the front of the battleship opens its gaping maw, staring at them through horrid
            yellow eyes. They strike at the Face, which clenches its teeth, sending bolts of
            lightning at them. It rears its head back as they attack and opens its mouth, sending an
            explosion of energy around them while its eyes glow. Taking the final blow, it roars and
            its head falls limp, the mouth opening. Another portal of darkness appears inside its
            jaw as more artillery appear on the front armaments of the battleship. Sora and Goofy
            fly into the portal, reaching another dark room filled with Invisible Heartless</desc>

        <desc>The Invisibles spin around, sending orbs of darkness around the room. Donald runs
            toward their voices as the three of the fight off the countless horde. Sora destroys the
            final Room Core and they escape the room through the portal. They fly back out of the
            mouth of the Face, which brims with smoke and explodes, leaving a dark blue wound on the
            front of the World of Chaos. The barrier to the cage in the battleship’s center
            collapses and they fly inside the cage, where they find the Main Core surrounded by
            artillery. They attack the Main Core as the artillery strike back</desc>

        <desc>He glows with a golden aura, raising his Keyblade into the air as three orbs descend
            to meet it. He touches them with the Keyblade and they gather, forming a three ringed
            orb. Sora jumps upside down, thrusting the Keyblade into the flesh of the cage. He spins
            around, holding the grip of the blade as a bright symbol appears around him. Beams erupt
            from the circles in the symbol and the orb above and the world is enveloped in light.
            The Main Core crackles with energy as the light fades. Energy catches its grip and it
            explodes. The Heartless Emblem above Ansem’s body shatters and Ansem slides forward, his
            silver hair trailing behind him. Straightening up, he crosses his hands and his pole
            sword reappears as he glares at Sora, Donald, and Goofy</desc>

            scattering through the abyss. Sora, Donald, and Goofy stare down at Ansem, who floats

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Sora nods, the penitent face of Riku his final sight before the door shuts. Sora leaps
            back and holds the Keyblade into the air, light forming at its tip gathering energy.
            Mickey swings his Keyblade around, releasing magical dust, and raises it into the air.
            The door begins to glow brightly and soon disappears, revealing a long winding pathway
            behind it. Sora, Donald, and Goofy stand still gazing into the void left in the door’s
            wake. Sora’s thoughts drift to Riku and their life on the Destiny Islands. When they
            talked for hours on the dock. When they gazed out at the sea from the paopu tree. When
            they used to play fight or race along the beach, laughing at each other. Life was a much
            simpler time then, before the Heartless. When it was just Sora, Riku and... Sora feels a
            presence behind him and turns, seeing Kairi at the edge of the world staring around in
            confusion. Sora runs towards her as fast as he can. Donald starts to follow, but Goofy
            stops him as a light appears behind them. They stare off in Sora’s direction as he runs
            toward the only thing on his mind. Kairi takes a few steps backward, her shoes digging
            into the soft sand on the tiny piece of beach she appeared on. It seems to be floating
            off the floating island into the abyss. Kairi looks up, her eyes catching Sora</desc>

        <sp>

            too.</sp>

        <desc>(As the worlds continue to drift apart, they hold hands, leaning forward to reach
            toward one another</desc>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I’ll come back to you. I promise!</sp>

    </cutscene>
    <cutscene>
        <desc>Their hands part and Kairi drifts away from Sora, who reaches out to her. She folds
            her hands together as they continue to stare back, when a small point of light floats
            down into Kairi’s hands. She looks up and the sky is filled with tiny points of light,
            the essence of worlds. They float down around the both of them as the Destiny Islands
            begin to reassemble around Kairi. Trees burst through the ground as the wooden platforms
            at the beach reform to the way they used to be. Kairi watches as the ocean rolls in.
            Sora smiles and calls out to Kairi as the world barrier forms, finally separating the
            two of them. Kairi looks down to the water as the light around Sora falls back. She
            looks up suddenly as the light bursts into shooting stars which fly into the sky,
            reclaiming their proper places. As the worlds are restored, Kairi’s face forms a small
            smile as she gazes at the beauty around her. Later, the sun and the clouds return and
            the island returns to normal. A soft wind blows through the flora and seagulls fly in
            the air as Kairi walks toward the Secret Place. A ray of light shines through the hole
            in the ceiling, illuminating the many drawings on the walls. She walks through the cave,
            touching the rough rocky walls, fondly recalling the memories with her friends. She
            reaches the furthest wall and kneels, seeing a new drawing of Sora giving Kairi a paopu
            fruit. Emotion wells up inside her as an image of Sora drawing on the walls appears
            before her. He stares back at her and smiles, before disappearing. She holds out a hand,
            smiling, and starts to cry. She ends her time in the Secret Place by drawing her hand
            giving Sora a paopu fruit. Back in Disney Castle, Chip and Dale call to the attention of
            Daisy and Queen Minnie. They look and see Huey, Dewey, and Louie running through the
            courtyard trailed by a procession of walking broomsticks. In the Library of Hollow
            Bastion, Leon, Yuffie, and Aerith converse with each other. The door opens and Aerith
            looks over seeing Cid and Cloud. Aerith moves closer and she bends down to stare into
            Cloud’s eyes. Meanwhile, Pinocchio has become a real boy and he dances with glee as
            Geppetto laughs happily. In Agrabah, Jasmine and Aladdin share a passionate kiss as
            Genie covers his and Abu’s eyes, but peeks anyway. On the Destiny Islands, Tidus, Wakka,
            and Selphie run along the beach as Belle, Aurora, Snow White, Cinderella, and Alice
            return to their respective worlds. Meanwhile, Sora, Donald, and Goofy walk down a
            winding dirt road on an unknown world</desc>

        <desc>With a flash, the dark city awakes. The neon lights paint the town as a hooded figure
            walks through the rainy streets. Raindrops form puddles on the pavement. Thunder rumbles
            and lightning flashes as the figure stops in front of a tall skyscraper with enormous
            video screens. Water falls over the man’s hood as he looks down to see glowing eyes
            appear from the ground. The Neoshadow Heartless rise up from below, unfazed by the cold
            rain. They quickly surround the man in an immense horde as a silver-haired man gazes
            down at him from above, despite the black blindfold across his eyes. The man whips out a
            Keyblade in his left hand, and then another in his right. He spins them in the air and
            clashes them together, creating sparks. They are the Oathkeeper and the Oblivion. Light
            and Darkness. Lightning flashes and the silver-haired man faces the sky with his arms
            outstretched. The clouds part, revealing a meteor shower as a fiery Heartless symbol
            appears on the ground between the hooded man and the Heartless. The silver-haired man
            removes his blindfold as the hooded man speaks <q>Where’s Sora?</q>
